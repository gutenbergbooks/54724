<h2 class="main">INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Many of the stories in this volume were told by an old
man who said he had more and better learning nor the scholars.
&ldquo;The like of them,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;do be filled with
conceit out of books, and the most of it only nonsense; &rsquo;tis
myself has the real old knowledge was handed down from the ancient
times.&rdquo; The spread of education and cheap literature robbed him
of audience: the boys read of adventure by land and sea, the girls
interested themselves in the fate of heroes with marble-white
complexion and coal-black moustache. But it happened that the old man
took a contract to break stones for lime, and a child with an
insatiable desire for information came to watch him at work. &ldquo;I
promise you will walk the world, like a Queen of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e174" href="#xd25e174" name=
"xd25e174">6</a>]</span>ancient days, renowned for learning and
wit,&rdquo; he assured her, delighted to find a listener at last. The
child was only seven years old, and could not remember all she heard,
so most of his lore died with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The King&rsquo;s Daughter of France,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Dark
Oath,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Nallagh&rsquo;s Child&rdquo; were told by other
friends.</p>
<p>The Folk Tale is essentially dramatic and loses much when it is
written down; moreover it is often put into a form unsuited to the
spirit of na&iuml;ve philosophy from whence it springs. The peasant of
ancient race is more akin to the aristocratic type than the bourgeois
can ever be&mdash;and the story told from generation to generation
bears greater resemblance to the work of a poet than to that of the
popular novelist, who is the bourgeois of literature. Superstition in a
race is merely the proof of imagination, the people lacking fairy lore
must also lack intelligence and wit.</p>

<p>There was once an old man of Ireland who was terrible poor, and he
lived by his lone in a small wee house by the roadside. At the morning
of the day he would go for to gather sticks in a wood was convenient to
that place, the way he&rsquo;d have a clear fire to be sitting at of an
evening.</p>
<p>It fell out one time, of a cold night, that Paddy heard a knock at
the door. He went over, and when he opened it he seen a little boy in a
red cap standing without.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let you come in and take an air to the fire,&rdquo; says he,
for he always had a good reception for every person.</p>
<p>The boy with the red cap walked in, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e480" href="#xd25e480" name=
"xd25e480">12</a>]</span>he stopped for a good while conversing. He was
the best of company, and the old man didn&rsquo;t find the time passing
until he rose for to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let you come in and rest yourself here any evening you are
out in these parts,&rdquo; says he.</p>
<p>The very next night the little fellow was in it again, and the night
after that, warming himself at the clear fire and talking away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paddy,&rdquo; says he, the evening he was in it for the third
time, &ldquo;Paddy, I do be thinking it is bitter poor you
are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am, surely,&rdquo; says the old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let you pay attention to me, it is the truth I&rsquo;m
speaking, you&rsquo;ll have more gold than ever you&rsquo;ll contrive
for to spend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could go through a fair share of gold,&rdquo; says
Paddy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am determined for to make a rich man of you,&rdquo; the
little boy goes on. &ldquo;There is a lady at the point of death, and
she is the King&rsquo;s daughter of France. I have a bottle here in my
pocket, and that is the cure for the disease is on her. I&rsquo;ll be
giving it to you, and let you set out for France at the morning of the
day. When you come to the King&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd25e497" href="#xd25e497" name="xd25e497">13</a>]</span>palace the
servants will bid you be gone for an ignorant beggar, but let you not
be heeding them at all. Don&rsquo;t quit asking to see the King, and in
the latter end they&rsquo;ll give in to you. It is with himself the
most difficulty will be, for that man will think it hard to believe the
likes of a poor old Irishman could have a better cure nor all the
doctors in the world. A power of them allowed they&rsquo;d have her
right well in no time, and it is worse they left her. The King is after
giving out that the next person coming with a false cure be to lose
their life. Let you not be scared at that decree, for you are the man
shall succeed. You may promise to have the lady fit to ride out hunting
in nine days. Three drops from the bottle is all you have to give her,
and that for three mornings after other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paddy paid great heed to all the boy in the red cap was telling him.
He took the wee bottle that was to make him a rich man, and he made
ready for to set out at the morning of the day.</p>
<p>He was a long time travelling the world before he came to the palace
where the King&rsquo;s daughter of France was lying at the point of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e503" href="#xd25e503" name=
"xd25e503">14</a>]</span>death. The servants made a great mock of the
poor old Irishman, but he paid no attention to their words at all. In
the latter end he got seeing the King, and that gentleman allowed the
likes of Paddy could never succeed when the doctors of the world were
after failing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d only be having the head cut off you, my poor old
man!&rdquo; says he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not the least bit in dread, your honour,&rdquo;
says Paddy. &ldquo;The lady is bound to be ready to ride out hunting in
nine days, if she uses my medicine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His perseverance and courage won over the King of France, and
permission was given for a trial of the cure.</p>
<p>The first morning, after taking the three drops from the bottle, the
lady turned in her bed. The second morning, after the treatment, she
sat up and ate her food.</p>
<p>The third morning, when she had taken the three drops, the
King&rsquo;s daughter of France rose from her bed. And in nine days she
was ready to ride out hunting.</p>
<p>They could not do enough for Paddy, there was great gratitude in
them. Well, the reward he accepted was a big sack of gold, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e517" href="#xd25e517" name=
"xd25e517">15</a>]</span>and that was the load he brought home to his
cabin in Ireland.</p>
<p>The first evening he was sitting by his clear fire, the little boy
came in at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I do well for you, Paddy?&rdquo; says he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did surely. I have more gold in that sack than ever
I&rsquo;ll contrive for to spend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, not at all! It is twice as much I&rsquo;ll be getting for
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it another King&rsquo;s daughter has need of a
cure?&rdquo; asks Paddy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but a different business entirely. There is a great bully
to be fought in the City of Dublin, and yourself is the man shall win
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you tell me so!&rdquo; says Paddy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In troth I do. The man you have to fight is a big, fierce
fellow no one can get the better of. He has the youth of the world
battered to pieces, the way no person comes forward against him any
more. There is a fine purse of money put up for to entice a champion to
face him; and there will be great laughter when yourself puts in an
appearance. They will ask if you are wishful to fight with gloves on
your hands, but it is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e536" href=
"#xd25e536" name="xd25e536">16</a>]</span>your bare fists are the best.
Let you say you&rsquo;ll toss for which it is to be, but toss with the
half-crown I give you, and you are certain to win. Myself is coming to
that place for to second you, and it&rsquo;s bound to be the grandest
bully was seen in the City of Dublin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that the little fellow went away out of the house. And at the
morning of the day my brave old Paddy started for Dublin. He
wasn&rsquo;t too long on the road, for he got a lift from a man was
driving there to see the bully. Well, there was odious laughing and
cheering when the crowd saw the champion was come to accept the
challenge. The big man was after battering the youth of the world,
allowed he had no notion of striving against the likes of Paddy. But
when no person else came forward they were bound for to accept him, and
they asked would he wear gloves on his fists.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be tossing for that,&rdquo; says he, bringing out
the half-crown he had from the little boy in the red cap.</p>
<p>He won the toss, sure enough, and he allowed it was bare-handed
he&rsquo;d strive. All the time he was looking round, anxious like,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e544" href="#xd25e544" name=
"xd25e544">17</a>]</span>but he could see no sign of the one that was
to second him. He went into the ring in odious dread; but then the
little fellow came and stood beside him. My brave Paddy let out and he
struck the champion one blow, and didn&rsquo;t he lay him dead at his
feet.</p>
<p>It was then there was roaring and cheering for the old man. And in
all the confusion the little lad got away; Paddy never seen where he
went. The whole crowd took up a terrible great collection of money for
the champion was after destroying the man with a single blow. That lot
of gold, along with the purse was promised for the fight, filled a sack
as full as it could hold. So Paddy went home well rewarded, and not a
bit the worse of his jaunt to the City of Dublin.</p>
<p>The first evening he was sitting by his own fireside, the little boy
in the red cap came in at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I do well for you, Paddy?&rdquo; says he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did, surely. It is rich for life I am owing to your
contrivances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then will you be doing me a service in return for all?&rdquo;
asks the little fellow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed then, I will,&rdquo; says Paddy. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e559" href="#xd25e559" name=
"xd25e559">18</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;We have all arranged for to cross over to France this night.
We intend for to bring away the lady you cured, the King&rsquo;s
daughter of that country,&rdquo; says the boy. &ldquo;But we cannot
contrive for to accomplish the like unless we have flesh and blood
along with us. Will you come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, surely!&rdquo; says Paddy.</p>
<p>With that the two went out at the door and across the road into a
field. It was thronged with regiments of the Good People, past belief
or counting. They were running every way through the field, calling
out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get me a horse, get me a horse!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And what were they doing only cutting down the bohlans and riding
away on them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get me a horse, get me a horse!&rdquo; says old Paddy,
calling out along with them.</p>
<p>But the fellow in the red cap came over to him looking terrible
vexed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let another word out of you,&rdquo; says he,
&ldquo;except one of ourselves speaks first. Mind what I&rsquo;m
telling you or it will be a cause of misfortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say no more except in answer to a question,&rdquo;
says Paddy.</p>
<p>With that they brought him a white <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd25e581" href="#xd25e581" name="xd25e581">19</a>]</span>yearling
calf, and put him up for to ride upon it. He thought it was a queer
sort of a horse, but he passed no remarks. And away they rode at a
great pace, the Good People on the bohlans and Paddy on the yearling
calf.</p>
<p>They made grand going, and it wasn&rsquo;t long before they came to
a big lake had an island in the middle of it. With one spring the whole
party landed on the island and with another they were safe on the far
shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dam, but that was a great lep for a yearling calf,&rdquo;
says Paddy.</p>
<p>With that one of the Good People struck him a blow on the head, the
way the sense was knocked out of him and he fell on the field.</p>
<p>At daylight the old man came to himself, and he lying on the field
by the big lake. He was a long journey from home, and he was weary
travelling round the water and over the hills to his own place. But the
worst of all was the sacks of gold: didn&rsquo;t every bit of the
fortune melt away and leave him poor, the way he was before he came in
with the Good People. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e591" href=

<div class="divBody">
<p>In the ancient times a man the name of M&rsquo;Gauran ruled in these
parts. He was a cruel tyrant surely and prouder than the High King of
Ireland or O&rsquo;Rourke was a Prince in Breffny. He conceited for to
build a house would stand to the end of time, a stronghold past the art
of man to overthrow or the fury of the wind to batter down. He gave out
that all the bullocks in his dominions were to be slaughtered and
mortar wet with the blood of them. Evenly the cows were not spared at
the latter end, the way a powerful lamentation went up from the poor of
the world were looking on the lonesome fields.</p>
<p>You that are young will be thinking the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e602" href="#xd25e602" name=
"xd25e602">24</a>]</span>blackness of his spirit and the cruelty of his
heart brought a curse on him to rot the flesh off his living bones. You
will be expectant of the story of a king, and he walking the provinces
of Ireland a skeleton and a warning to the eyes of man. But the aged
and wise have understanding to know of the tribulation laid out for the
good and the just, they putting their sorrows over them in this world
where the evil have prosperity. The like will be enduring for a short
space only, and a queer fate waits the wicked in the age-long hours of
eternity. Proud is the tyrant and wealthy till they set him in the
clay: humbled with fear is his spirit at the journey&rsquo;s end.</p>
<p>There was a widow woman had her little dwelling convenient to where
M&rsquo;Gauran was building his castle. Gold she had none, nor evenly a
coin was of silver, one cow only was her riches on the earth. (And
surely them that had heart to molest her like would be robbing the dead
of the raiment is with them in the grave.) Herself was more nor horrid
lonesome the day she seen the creature driven from her by a man of the
chiefs, he having a lengthy knife in his hand.</p>
<p>At the fall of night a traveller came to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e608" href="#xd25e608" name=
"xd25e608">25</a>]</span>the poor woman&rsquo;s cabin door. He was a
bent, aged man with a sorrowful countenance on him, and the garments
did cover him were rags. She invited him within, giving him the kindly
welcome, and she set out what food was in the place for his
refreshment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is destroyed I am with a parching drouth is splitting my
gullet,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;and I walking the mountainy ways since
the screech of dawn. The sun was splitting the bushes at the noon of
day, and the fury of it was eating into my skin. But no person took
compassion on me at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that the widow set a mug of milk before him, and it the last
drop was in the countryside. He drank it down, middling speedy, and he
held out the cup to be filled again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a heart scald surely,&rdquo; says herself,
&ldquo;that I be to refuse the request of a man is weary walking the
territory of Ireland, since the rising sun brought light on his path.
There is a king in these parts, stranger, and he has the cattle
destroyed on the poor of the world, the way he will have a lasting
mortar to his house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t yourself after giving me the loveliest
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e618" href="#xd25e618" name=
"xd25e618">26</a>]</span>mug of sweet milk?&rdquo; says he, like one
was doubtful of the honesty of her words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last drop was in this townland, stranger, and it is heart
glad I am that it refreshed you. I had but the one cow only, the
grandest milker in the land, and she was driven from me this
day&mdash;up yonder to the masons are working with their shovels
dripping red.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am thinking it is four strong walls in the pit of Hell are
building for that chieftain&rsquo;s soul. Maybe it&rsquo;s red hot
they&rsquo;ll be, and he imprisoned within them for a thousand years
and more,&rdquo; says the traveller.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let there be what masonry there will in the next world, the
wealth of the people cements his castle there beyond. For the cow and
the milk and the butter are the gold of the dwellers on the
land,&rdquo; says the widow. &ldquo;But let you be resting a while in
this place: what haste is on you to depart?&rdquo; For she seen he was
rising to be gone.</p>
<p>He raised his hand in benediction, and the voice of him speaking was
that sweet it charmed the birds off the bushes, the way they flew round
him in the darkening night. &ldquo;May the blessing of the King of
Heaven be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e629" href="#xd25e629"
name="xd25e629">27</a>]</span>upon you. May He send you a cow will
never run dry, and you milking her at all seasons of the year to the
day of your departure from the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that the place was bare of his presence. He was gone the like
of a spirit has power to travel the land unseen.</p>
<p>At the morning of the day following the poor woman stood at her
cottage door, facing out to the mountains are a long journey from that
place. Didn&rsquo;t she see a great wonder:&mdash;A piece fell clean
from the hillside and from it came a cow, white as the driven snow, she
travelling faster nor the wind. The widow seen all as clear as we do be
regarding the rising of the sun in the Eastern sky. Whatever power was
laid on her eyes the distance was no obstruction to her vision that
day. But it was not until the creature came and stood by herself that
she bethought her of the benediction of the traveller, and the cow
would never run dry.</p>
<p>That was the beast had the great renown on her: people came from
every art and part to be looking on her. The milk she gave was richer
nor the best of cream, and the butter off it was the best in Ireland.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e637" href="#xd25e637" name=

<p>The day the widow died, a young child seen the white cow travelling
away to the mountains. And no man beheld her more, nor evenly heard
tell of the like. But the Gap of Glan confronts us to this day, and
that is where the creature rose to the light of the world. <span class=

May eve that a young child seen her, and she milking the cushogues
along with a score of the fairies. Another night a man on his way from
a distant fair found her on the road before him riding with the little
horseman.</p>
<p>One day Kate Ellen came into the kitchen of a friend&rsquo;s house,
and she stopped there chatting for an hour&rsquo;s time. She allowed
that she&rsquo;d surely die in a short space for the disease was making
great ravages and the doctors could take no hold of it at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No person can give me the least relief in the world,&rdquo;
says she. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll be making but the one request of my
friends and neighbours, let there be no whiskey at the wake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure the like was never heard tell of before,&rdquo; says the
woman of the house. &ldquo;What use would there be in a dry
wake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe no use at all, as you are after saying,&rdquo; answers
Kate Ellen. &ldquo;But let you pay heed to my words or there&rsquo;s
like to be a queer story told at the end of time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis the raving of death is on you, my poor
creature,&rdquo; says the woman of the house. &ldquo;Sure you&rsquo;ll
be the beautiful corpse and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e663"
href="#xd25e663" name="xd25e663">33</a>]</span>every one of us paying
our best respects to the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not a long after Kate Ellen was found in her own house and she lying
dead on the floor. All the friends and neighbours gathered in for the
wake, and what had they along with them only a beautiful jar of the
best whiskey. They could not think to give in to the arrangement
herself set out, that they&rsquo;d remain in the place with a parching
drouth for company.</p>
<p>The whole party were sitting round, and the jar of itself was in the
middle of the floor. There came a noise and shouting on the street,
like as if there was a powerful assembly of people without; and then a
great battering on the windows. The door opened wide and the
disturbance came into the kitchen, yet no person sitting there seen a
heth that was not in it from the start. It was a queer gathering
surely, for the friends and neighbours of the dead were silent and
still, and the crying went round them on the air.</p>
<p>After a while didn&rsquo;t the jar of whiskey let a lep out of it
and begin for to roll on the floor. It was turned again and every drop
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e672" href="#xd25e672" name=
"xd25e672">34</a>]</span>teemed from it before the watching eyes. Yet
no person seen the Good People were handling the drink and roving
through the house. Then the disturbance passed from the kitchen, and
away down the field, whatever was last for to go closed the door behind
all.</p>
<p>A man stood up and he says: &ldquo;This is no right gathering
surely, and we would do well to be gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that another opens the door, and all made ready to depart. But
when they looked out and seen the fort all thronged with lights they
grew fearful to quit the house.</p>
<p>There was the powerfullest laughter and cheering down among the
thorn trees of the circle, and there came a blast of the loveliest
music&mdash;fiddles and pipes and voices singing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the Good People are having the whole beautiful wake
down there beyond,&rdquo; says a man. &ldquo;Sure it is well known Kate
Ellen was in league with themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the powers, it is more like a wedding they are conducting
this hour,&rdquo; says another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on away home,&rdquo; says a third, &ldquo;what
enticement is on us stop when the drink is gone from us to the fairies
are fiddling with joy!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e686"
href="#xd25e686" name="xd25e686">35</a>]</span></p>
<p>But they bid him depart by his lone, for the rest were in dread of
passing the fort before day. He was a bold, daring sort of a man, and
it&rsquo;s likely he&rsquo;d have gone only for his brother taking a
hold of his coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be taken by the Good People,&rdquo; says he,
&ldquo;and they in great humour after whipping off with the whiskey
before our eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sure it was more nor horrid wonderful that Kate Ellen had
understanding for to know what might be taking place on the night of
her departure from home. Maybe it&rsquo;s in agreement she was to be
going for good with the fairies and not to her grave at all.

<div class="divBody">
<p>In the ancient times there was a young lad, and he gifted with a
temper was a fright to the world of man. He never controlled his speech
but took delight in letting great oaths and curses out of him, they
rising continually in his heart like water in a spring well.</p>
<p>There were few of the neighbours had a mind to make free with
himself, sure it was an odious dread came upon them and they regarding
the villainy of his heart lepping out at his mouth with the words
speaking. All the time he was middling great with another gosoon of the
one age who would not be warned from his company.</p>
<p>The two would be travelling the roads and roaming the fields of
Connacht from the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e706" href=
"#xd25e706" name="xd25e706">40</a>]</span>screech of dawn to dark. But
for all their diversions together they fell out on a summer&rsquo;s
day, and it was blows they gave one another until a strong perspiration
ran down from them and the air moved before their eyes like the stars
of heaven on a frosty night. Neither could gain the mastery, and at
long last they be to quit striving for they were bone weary and feeble
as an infant child.</p>
<p>The one was hasty in his speech let a dark oath that he would be the
death of his companion, evenly if the power of the lonesome grave
itself was set between them to hold him from the fulfilment of his
vow.</p>
<p>In three days from the time the words were spoken he died of a
strange, sudden sickness.</p>
<p>The other had a great satisfaction on him, he having no dread of a
man was rotting in the clay, where rich and poor are alike and the
strong have no mastery above the weak. But in a short while a warning
came to the lad in a dream, the way he walked the world in fear from
that out:&mdash;</p>
<p>He seen a field where he was standing by his lone to confront a
black bull was charging down. The eyes of the beast were glowing red as
burning fire, and it was no right <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd25e716" href="#xd25e716" name="xd25e716">41</a>]</span>thing surely.
There was such a fluttering of dread on the boy that he could not
endeavour for to run, but he stood like a growing rush does be waving
with the breeze. Three times the likeness of the great black bull came
down against him, wounding him with the curved and lengthy horns were
upon it; with that he awoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The devil will be gifting the spirit of the dead with the
form of a living beast, the way he&rsquo;ll get bringing me the dark
destruction he promised, and I looking fearful at the flames are
burning in his eyes,&rdquo; thinks the lad.</p>
<p>Sure enough, in a month&rsquo;s time, he was in a field, and the
appearance of the black bull came against him. Three times it struck
him, the way he was tormented with the agony of the goring horns. With
that the likeness of the living beast faded from the place leaving the
young lad sore and sorry but alive.</p>
<p>He had peace for a short space only to be thinking on his escape.
Didn&rsquo;t a second warning come in the night to restore the cold
fear to his heart:&mdash;</p>
<p>He seen a black goat come at him in <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd25e727" href="#xd25e727" name="xd25e727">42</a>]</span>standing
leps, and the eyes of it were glowing like a turf in the heart of a
strong fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is less power the devil be&rsquo;s giving him this
time,&rdquo; thinks the lad. &ldquo;All the while &rsquo;tis an ill
hour stands before me: the like of yon beast will be middling weighty
and it striking me in a standing lep with no one of its four feet upon
the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All came about as it was put on his eyes in the vision. Not a many
days went by before the likeness of the great black goat threw its
strength against him in the field. Three sore batterings he be to
endure, the way he was left lying on the grass with every bone of him
tormented in pain and a cold fear at his soul.</p>
<p>When the wounds were healed on his body and the passing of time
restored his mind to a better peace, didn&rsquo;t he behold a third
dream of the night:&mdash;</p>
<p>He stood in the lane between his house and the field, and the
appearance of a great turkey cock flew down upon him from the sky.</p>
<p>At that he let a hearty laugh, and he roused up in his bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure the devil has little wit to be thinking <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e741" href="#xd25e741" name=
"xd25e741">43</a>]</span>I&rsquo;ll take my death from the like,&rdquo;
says he. &ldquo;And how would it be possible a fine, stout-hearted lad
could be scared by the fowls of the sky!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed that night, and he laughed at the noon of day when the
bird flew against him in the lane. But the appearance of the turkey
cock opened the joining of his skull with one blow of the beak like a
sharpened knife was upon it. The second stroke and the third dashed the
brains from his head and scattered them grey on the brown and dusty
path.</p>
<p>And that is the how he came to a bad death as his companion promised
him, and the dark oath was accomplished no spite of the power of the
grave.</p>
<p>We that are yet in this world know well where we are, but ignorance
is on us of where we be to repair. Sure the passing of the spirit is
the strangest and awfullest thing was ever devised or heard tell of. It
was said in the ancient times and is well known to this present that
the soul quits the body by the joining of the skull. The eyes have seen
evil, the ears have heard it, and the mouth has made laughter and
speech of the same: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e750" href=
"#xd25e750" name="xd25e750">44</a>]</span>how then would they be a
right and a fitting doorway for the feet of the spirit to pass!
Moreover, I have heard tell that the skull of man and the skull of
woman are different one from another&mdash;and it is the soul of
herself has the sorest departure from the flesh. <span class=

<p>It happened one time that a poor man dreamt three nights after other
of a sack of fairy gold was buried in under the roots of a lone bush
and it growing in a field convenient to his house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be there is nothing in it,&rdquo; says he to himself.
&ldquo;But I will be digging in that place and if I find a treasure it
will be a big reward for the labour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He never let on a word of his intentions to any person, nor did he
evenly pass any remark on the strange dreams were after coming to him.
At the fall of the day he took a loy in his hand and set out for the
lone bush. He was not a great while at work before the steel blade
struck against a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e765" href=
"#xd25e765" name="xd25e765">48</a>]</span>substance that had no feel of
clay, and the man was full sure it was not a stone he was after
striking against. He wraught hard to bring whatever was in it to
light&mdash;and what had he only a powerful fine sack of pure gold and
splendid jewels.</p>
<p>He raised it up on his shoulders and set out for home, staggering
under the load. It was maybe a hundredweight of treasure he had with
him, and he went along planning out the uses of that wealth. Sure the
burden was a rejoicement to him and no hardship at all evenly if it had
him bent double like an aged and crippled man.</p>
<p>When he came to his own place he went to the byre, and it was there
he put down the sack in front of three cows were standing in the bails.
For he was not wishful to be making a display of that splendour before
the neighbours all, and it was likely he would find some person within
making their cailee. Sure enough when he went in on the door of the
house he seen two men sitting by the fire and they in no haste to
depart. Now the strangers had the English only, and the people of the
house spoke Irish with one another. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd25e771" href="#xd25e771" name="xd25e771">49</a>]</span></p>
<p>Says himself, using the Gaelic, &ldquo;I have a beautiful treasure
without&mdash;bars of fine gold are in it, and jewels would be the
delight of a queen of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, bring it into the house,&rdquo; says she. &ldquo;Sure it
will rise my heart to be looking on the like; the hunger of it is put
on my eyes by your words speaking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have better wit than to make display of my fortune to every
person is living in the land,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;Let you content
yourself until the two men have departed, and then we&rsquo;ll fetch
the sack in from the byre where I left it in front of the
cows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the man and woman of the house were shut of the company they
went out to the yard, and they fair wild with delight. Himself told the
story of the three dreams and the finding of the gold in under the
roots of the lone bush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you spit on it?&rdquo; she inquires.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not,&rdquo; says he.</p>
<p>With that she allowed he was after making a big mistake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How would that be?&rdquo; he asks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father had great knowledge of the like,&rdquo; says
herself. &ldquo;I often heard him tell <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd25e791" href="#xd25e791" name="xd25e791">50</a>]</span>of how those
treasures do be enchanted, and power is on them for to melt away. But
if a man was to spit on fairy gold he&rsquo;d get keeping it
surely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amn&rsquo;t I after bringing it this far,&rdquo; says he,
&ldquo;and the weight of it destroying my shoulders with bruises and
pains. Not the least sign of melting was on yon article and it a
warrant to bring down the scales at a hundred and more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that they went into the byre, and they seen the three cows were
striving to break out of the bails.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are in dread of what&rsquo;s lying there in
front,&rdquo; says herself. &ldquo;The cattle of the world have good
wisdom surely, and they do be looking on more nor the eye of man gets
leave to behold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quit raving about the cows,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;Look at my
lovely sack and it bulging full.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the two went up to the head of the bails the woman let a great
cry out of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you after bringing to this place from among the
roots of the lone bush? It has the movement of life in it&mdash;and how
could the like be treasure at all!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd25e806" href="#xd25e806" name="xd25e806">51</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your whisht, woman,&rdquo; says the husband, and he
middling vexed at her words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you look at the bag is turning over on the
ground?&rdquo; says she.</p>
<p>He seen there was truth in her words, but all the while he would not
give in to be scared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is likely a rat is after creeping in,&rdquo; he allows,
&ldquo;and he is having his own times striving to win out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let you open the sack, and I will be praying aloud for
protection on us&mdash;for it is no right thing is in it at all,&rdquo;
says herself.</p>
<p>With that he went over and he turned the hundredweight of treasure
until he had it propped up against the bails. When he began for to open
the bag the cows went fair wild, striving and roaring and stamping to
get away from the place entirely.</p>
<p>The head of a great eel looked out from under the man&rsquo;s hand
where he was groping for the treasure. The eyes of it were the colour
of flame and as blinding to the sight as the naked sun at noon of a
summer&rsquo;s day.</p>
<p>The man gave one lep that carried him to the door and there the
paralysis of dread held him down. Herself let a scream could be
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e823" href="#xd25e823" name=
"xd25e823">52</a>]</span>heard in the next townland, but she never
asked to stir from where she was standing.</p>
<p>The appearance of the eel twisted itself out of the sack and
travelled along the ground, putting the six feet of its length into the
awfullest loops and knots were ever seen. Then it reared up its head
and neck to stand swaying for a while, a full half of it in the air.
The man and woman were convenient to the door but the both were too
scared to go out on it; they watched the eel and they seen it twist up
round a bail until the head of it was touching the roof. Didn&rsquo;t
it break away out through the thatch, and whether it melted off the
face of the earth or travelled to other parts was never heard tell. But
the likeness of that beast was the whole and only treasure came out of
the sack the poor man dug from under the roots of the lone bush where
the fairy gold was hid. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e827" href=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was a fine young gentleman the name of
M&rsquo;Carthy, he had a most beautiful countenance and for strength
and prowess there was none to equal him in the baronies of Connacht.
But he began to dwine away, and no person knew what ailed him. He used
no food at all and he became greatly reduced, the way he was not able
to rise from his bed and he letting horrid groans and lamentations out
of him. His father sent for three skilled doctors to come and find out
what sort of disease it might be, and a big reward was promised for the
cure.</p>
<p>Three noted doctors came on the one day and they searched every vein
in young <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e841" href="#xd25e841" name=
"xd25e841">56</a>]</span>M&rsquo;Carthy&rsquo;s body, but they could
put no name on the sickness nor think of a remedy to relieve it. They
came down from the room and reported that the disease had them baffled
entirely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I to be at the loss of a son is the finest boy in all
Ireland?&rdquo; says the father.</p>
<p>Now one of the doctors had a man with him was a very soft-spoken
person, and he up and says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe your honours would be giving me permission to visit the
young gentleman. I have a tongue on me is that sweet I do be drawing
the secrets of the world out of men and women and little
children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well they brought him up to the room and they left him alone with
M&rsquo;Carthy. He sat down by the side of the bed and began for to
flatter him, the like of such conversation was never heard before.</p>
<p>At long last he says, &ldquo;Let your Lordship&rsquo;s honour be
telling me&mdash;What is it ails you at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will never let on to a living soul?&rdquo; asks
M&rsquo;Carthy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it that I&rsquo;d be lodging an information against a
noble person like yourself?&rdquo; says the man. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e857" href="#xd25e857" name=
"xd25e857">57</a>]</span></p>
<p>With that the young gentleman began telling the secrets of his
heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is no disease is on me,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;but a
terrible misfortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis heart scalded I am that you have either a sorrow
or a sickness, and you grand to look on and better to listen to,&rdquo;
says the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is in love I am,&rdquo; says M&rsquo;Carthy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how would that be a misfortune to a fine lad like
yourself?&rdquo; asks the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let you never let on!&rdquo; says M&rsquo;Carthy. &ldquo;The
way of it is this: I am lamenting for no lady is walking the world, nor
for one is dead that I could be following to the grave. I have a little
statue has the most beautiful countenance on it was ever seen, and it
is destroyed with grief I am that it will never be speaking to me at
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that he brought the image out from under his pillow, and the
loveliness of it made the man lep off the chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be stealing the wee statue from your honour if I
stopped in this place,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;But let you take valour
into your heart, for that is the likeness of a lady is living in the
world, you will be finding her surely.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e875" href="#xd25e875" name=
"xd25e875">58</a>]</span></p>
<p>With that he went down to the three doctors and the old man were
waiting below. For all his promises to young M&rsquo;Carthy he told the
lot of them all he was after hearing. The doctors allowed that if the
gentleman&rsquo;s life was to be saved he must be got out of his bed
and sent away on his travels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a time he will be hopeful of finding her,&rdquo; says the
oldest doctor. &ldquo;Then the whole notion will pass off him, and he
seeing strange lands and great wonders to divert him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The father was that anxious for the son&rsquo;s recovery that he
agreed to sell the place and give him a big handful of money for the
journey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is little I&rsquo;ll be needing for myself from this out,
and I am old man near ripe for the grave,&rdquo; says he.</p>
<p>So they all went up to the room and told young M&rsquo;Carthy to
rise from his bed and eat a good dinner, for the grandest arrangements
out were made for his future and he&rsquo;d surely meet the lady. When
he seen that no person was mocking him he got into the best of humour,
and he came down and feasted with them.</p>
<p>Not a long afterwards he took the big <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd25e889" href="#xd25e889" name="xd25e889">59</a>]</span>handful of
money and set out on his travels, bringing the statue with him. He went
over the provinces of Ireland, then he took sea to England and wandered
it entirely, away to France with him next and from that to every art
and part of the world. He had the strangest adventures, and he seen
more wonders than could ever be told or remembered. At the latter end
he came back to the old country again, with no more nor a coin or two
left of the whole great fortune of money. The whole time he never seen
a lady was the least like the wee statue; and the words of the old
doctor were only a deceit for he didn&rsquo;t quit thinking of her at
all. M&rsquo;Carthy was a handsome young gentleman, and if it was small
heed he had for any person he met it was great notice was taken of him.
Sure it was a Queen, no less, and five or six princesses were thinking
long thoughts on himself.</p>
<p>The hope was near dead in his heart and the sickness of grief was on
him again when he came home to Ireland. Soon after he landed from the
ship he chanced to come on a gentleman&rsquo;s place, and it a fine big
house he never had seen before. He went up and inquired of the servants
if he would get leave <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e893" href=
"#xd25e893" name="xd25e893">60</a>]</span>to rest there. He was given a
most honourable reception, and the master of the house was well pleased
to be entertaining such an agreeable guest. Now himself happened to be
a Jew, and that is the why he did not ask M&rsquo;Carthy to eat at his
table, but had his dinner set out for him in a separate room. The
servants remarked on the small share of food he was using, it was
scarcely what would keep the life in a young child; but he asked them
not to make any observation of the sort. At first they obeyed him, yet
when he used no meat at all on the third day, didn&rsquo;t they speak
with their master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the cause of it at all?&rdquo; he says to
M&rsquo;Carthy. &ldquo;Is the food in this place not to your liking?
Let you name any dish you have a craving for, and the cook will prepare
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was never better refreshment set before an
emperor,&rdquo; says M&rsquo;Carthy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is civility makes you that flattering,&rdquo; answers the
Jew. &ldquo;How would you be satisfied with the meat is set before you
when you are not able to use any portion of it at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt I have a sickness on me will be <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e903" href="#xd25e903" name=
"xd25e903">61</a>]</span>the means of my death,&rdquo; says
M&rsquo;Carthy. &ldquo;I had best be moving on from this place, the way
I&rsquo;ll not be rewarding your kindness with the botheration of a
corpse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that the master of the house began for to speak in praise of a
doctor was in those parts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see I must be telling you what is in it,&rdquo; says
M&rsquo;Carthy. &ldquo;Doctors have no relief for the sort of
tribulation is destroying me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He brought out the statue, and he went over the whole story from
start to finish. How he set off on his travels and was hopeful for
awhile; and how despair got hold of him again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let you be rejoicing now,&rdquo; says the Jew, &ldquo;for it
is near that lady you are this day. She comes down to a stream is
convenient to this place, and six waiting maids along with her,
bringing a rod and line for to fish. And it is always at the one hour
she is in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, M&rsquo;Carthy was lepping wild with delight to hear tell of
the lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let you do all I&rsquo;m saying,&rdquo; the Jew advises him.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll provide you with the best of fishing tackle, and do
you go down to the stream for to fish in it too. Whatever comes
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e918" href="#xd25e918" name=
"xd25e918">62</a>]</span>to your line let you give to the lady. But say
nothing might scare her at all and don&rsquo;t follow after her if she
turns to go home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day M&rsquo;Carthy went out for to fish, not a long was he
at the stream before the lady came down and the six waiting maids along
with her. Sure enough she was the picture of the statue, and she had
the loveliest golden hair was ever seen.</p>
<p>M&rsquo;Carthy had the luck to catch a noble trout, and he took it
off the hook, rolled it in leaves and brought it to the lady, according
to the advice of the Jew. She was pleased to accept the gift of it, but
didn&rsquo;t she turn home at once and the six waiting maids along with
her. When she went into her own house she took the fish to her
father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a noble person at the stream this day,&rdquo; she
says, &ldquo;and he made me a present of the trout.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next morning M&rsquo;Carthy went to fish again, and he seen the lady
coming and her six waiting maids walking behind her. He caught a
splendid fine trout and brought it over to her; with that she turned
home at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; says she, when she went in, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e930" href="#xd25e930" name=
"xd25e930">63</a>]</span>&ldquo;the gentleman is after giving me a fish
is bigger and better nor the one I brought back yesterday. If the like
happens at the next time I go to the stream I will be inviting the
noble person to partake of refreshment in this place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let you do as best pleases yourself,&rdquo; says her
father.</p>
<p>Well, sure enough, M&rsquo;Carthy got the biggest trout of all the
third time. The lady was in the height of humour, and she asked would
he go up to the house with her that day. She walked with M&rsquo;Carthy
beside her, and the six waiting maids behind them. They conversed very
pleasantly together, and at last he found courage for to tell her of
how he travelled the world to seek no person less than herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fearing you&rsquo;ll need to set out on a second
journey, the way you will be coming in with some other one,&rdquo; says
she. &ldquo;I have an old father is after refusing two score of suitors
were asking me off him. I do be thinking I&rsquo;ll not get joining the
world at all, unless a king would be persuading himself of the
advancement is in having a son-in-law wearing a golden crown upon his
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e938" href="#xd25e938" name=
"xd25e938">64</a>]</span>head. The whole time it is great freedom I
have, and I walking where it pleases me with six waiting maids along
with me. The old man has a notion they&rsquo;d inform him if I was up
to any diversion, but that is not the way of it at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is funning you are, surely,&rdquo; says M&rsquo;Carthy.
&ldquo;If himself is that uneasy about you how would it be possible
you&rsquo;d bring me to the house to be speaking with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a kindly man and reasonable,&rdquo; says she,
&ldquo;and it is a good reception you&rsquo;ll be getting. Only let you
not be speaking of marriage with me, for he cannot endure to hear tell
of the like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, the old man made M&rsquo;Carthy welcome, and he had no
suspicion the two were in notion of other. But didn&rsquo;t they
arrange all <span class="corr" id="xd25e947" title=
"Source: unbeknownt">unbeknownst</span> to him, and plan out an
elopement.</p>
<p>M&rsquo;Carthy went back to the Jew, and he told him all.
&ldquo;But,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I am after spending my whole great
fortune of money travelling the territory of the world. I must be
finding a good situation the way I&rsquo;ll make suitable provision for
herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be in the least distress,&rdquo; says the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e954" href="#xd25e954" name=
"xd25e954">65</a>]</span>Jew. &ldquo;I did not befriend you this far to
be leaving you in a bad case at the latter end. I&rsquo;ll oblige you
with the loan of what money will start you in a fine place. You will be
making repayment at the end of three years when you have made your
profit on the business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young gentleman accepted the offer, and he fair wild with
delight. Moreover, the Jew gave himself and the lady grand assistance
at the elopement, the way they got safe out of it and escaped from her
father was raging in pursuit.</p>
<p>M&rsquo;Carthy was rejoicing surely, and he married to a wife was
the picture of the statue. Herself was in the best of humour too, for
it was small delight she had in her own place, roaming the fields or
stopping within and six waiting maids along with her. A fine, handsome
husband was the right company for her like. They bought a lovely house
and farm of land with the money was lent by the Jew; and they fixed all
the grandest ever was seen. After a while M&rsquo;Carthy got a good
commission to be an officer, the way nothing more in the world was
needful to their happiness. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e960"

<p class="first">M&rsquo;Carthy and his lady had a fine life of it,
they lacking for no comfort or splendour at all. The officer&rsquo;s
commission he had, brought himself over to England from time to time,
and the lady M&rsquo;Carthy would mind all until he was home. He saved
up what money was superfluous, and all was gathered to repay the loan
to the Jew only for a few pounds.</p>
<p>Well it happened that M&rsquo;Carthy went to England, and there he
fell in with a droll sort of a man was the best of company. They played
cards together and they drank a great power of wine. In the latter end
a dispute came about between them, for the both claimed to have the
best woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a lady beyond in Ireland,&rdquo; says M&rsquo;Carthy,
&ldquo;and she is an ornament to the roads when she is passing along.
But no person gets seeing her these times and that is a big misfortune
to the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the cause?&rdquo; asks the Englishman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have a grief on me to think another man might be
looking on her and I not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e974" href=
"#xd25e974" name="xd25e974">67</a>]</span>standing by,&rdquo; says
M&rsquo;Carthy. &ldquo;So she gives me that satisfaction on her
promised word: all the time I do be away she never quits the house, and
no man body is allowed within.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Englishman let a great laugh out of him at the words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are simple enough!&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
know rightly when you are not in it herself will be feasting and
entertaining and going on with every diversion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>M&rsquo;Carthy was raging at the impertinence of him, and he offered
for to fight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would that be proving?&rdquo; says the Englishman.
&ldquo;Let you make a powerful big bet with myself that I will not be
able for to bring you a token from your lady and a full description of
her appearance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be winning the money off you, surely!&rdquo; says
M&rsquo;Carthy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; says the Englishman. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
in the least uneasy about it, for I&rsquo;m full sure it&rsquo;s the
truth I&rsquo;m after speaking of how she does be playing herself in
your absence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find me in this place and you coming
back,&rdquo; says M&rsquo;Carthy. &ldquo;Let you be prepared with the
money to have along with you.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd25e991" href="#xd25e991" name="xd25e991">68</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Englishman took ship to Ireland, and he came to the house of the
lady M&rsquo;Carthy. Herself was in the kitchen making a cake, and she
seen the man walking up to the door. Away she run to the parlour, and
in the hurry she forgot the lovely pearl ring she took off her finger
when she began at the cooking. Well, he found the door standing open,
and he seen the ring on the kitchen table. It was easy knowing it was
no common article would be in the possession of any one but the
mistress of the house. What did the lad do, only slip in and put it in
his pocket. With that the waiting maid came and asked his business, the
lady M&rsquo;Carthy was after sending her down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no business at all,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;But I am weary
travelling and I thought I might rest in this place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He began for to flatter the girl and to offer her bribes, and in the
latter end he got her to speak. She told him all what the mistress of
the house was like; how she had a mole under her right arm and one on
her left knee. Moreover she gave him a few long golden hairs she got
out of the lady&rsquo;s comb. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e998"
href="#xd25e998" name="xd25e998">69</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Englishman went back to M&rsquo;Carthy, brought him the tokens,
and demanded the payment of the bet. And that is the way the poor
gentleman spent the money he had saved up for the Jew.</p>
<p>M&rsquo;Carthy sent word to his wife that he was coming home, and
for her to meet him on the ship. She put her grandest raiment upon her
and started away at once. She went out to the ship and got up on the
deck where she seen her husband standing. When she went over to him he
never said a word at all, but he swept her aside with his arm the way
she fell into the water. Then he went on shore full sure he had her
drowned.</p>
<p>But there was another ship coming in, and a miller that was on her
seen the lady struggling in the sea. He was an aged man, yet he
ventured in after her and he saved the poor creature&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>Well, the miller was a good sort of a man and he had great
compassion for herself when she told him her story. She had no
knowledge of the cause of her husband being vexed with her, and she
thought it hard to believe the evidence of her senses that he was after
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1007" href="#xd25e1007" name=
"xd25e1007">70</a>]</span>striving to make away with her. The miller
advised the lady M&rsquo;Carthy to go on with the ship was sailing to
another port, for may be if she went home after the man he would be
destroying her.</p>
<p>When the ship came into harbour the news was going of a great
lawsuit. The miller heard all, and he brought word to the lady that
M&rsquo;Carthy was in danger of death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are three charges against him,&rdquo; says the miller.
&ldquo;Your father has him impeached for stealing you away and you not
wishful to be with him: that is the first crime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a false charge,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;for I helped
for to plan the whole elopement. My father is surely saying all in good
faith, but it is a lie the whole time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Jew has him accused for a sum of money was borrowed, and it
due for repayment: that is the second crime,&rdquo; says the
miller.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The money was all gathered up for to pay the debt,&rdquo;
says the lady. &ldquo;Where can it be if M&rsquo;Carthy will not
produce it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The law has him committed for the murder of yourself: and
that is the third crime,&rdquo; says the miller. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1022" href="#xd25e1022" name=
"xd25e1022">71</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;And a false charge too, seeing you saved me in that ill hour.
I am thinking I&rsquo;d do well to be giving evidence in court of law,
for it&rsquo;s maybe an inglorious death they&rsquo;ll be giving
him,&rdquo; says she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that what he laid out for yourself?&rdquo; asks
the miller.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is surely, whatever madness came to him. But I have a good
wish for him the whole time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that is the way of it we had best be setting out,&rdquo;
says he.</p>
<p>The lady and the miller travelled overland, it being a shorter
journey nor the one they were after coming by sea. When they got to the
court of law wasn&rsquo;t the judge after condemning M&rsquo;Carthy;
and it was little the poor gentleman cared for the sentence of death
was passed on him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My life is bitter and poisoned on me,&rdquo; says he,
&ldquo;maybe the grave is the best place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that the lady M&rsquo;Carthy stood up in the court and gave out
that she had not been destroyed at all, for the miller saved her from
the sea.</p>
<p>They began the whole trial over again, and herself told how she
planned the elopement, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1040" href=
"#xd25e1040" name="xd25e1040">72</a>]</span>and her father had no case
at all. She could not tell why M&rsquo;Carthy was wishful to destroy
her, and he had kept all to himself at the first trial. But by degrees
all was brought to light: the villainy of the Englishman and the deceit
was practised on them by him and the servant girl.</p>
<p>It was decreed that the money was to be restored by that villain,
and the Jew was to get his payment out of it.</p>
<p>The lady M&rsquo;Carthy&rsquo;s father was in such rejoicement to
see his daughter and she alive, that he forgave herself and the husband
for the elopement. Didn&rsquo;t the three of them go away home together
and they the happiest people were ever heard tell of in the world.

<p>In the ancient days there were a power of the Good People travelling
the land of Breffny. It was easy knowing they were middling proud and
conceity in themselves, for they rode upon what appeared to be horses
and had music with them, no less! Children were changed by the fairies
too, and no matter what way they were reared the like never grew to be
right things.</p>
<p>There was once a man the name of Nallagh, lived in a tidy little
place beyond the river. The wife and himself had one child, a gosoon,
that could never be learned to speak, nor walk, nor stand upright, nor
evenly to crawl upon the floor. The whole time the creature had all his
makes and shapes <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1057" href=
"#xd25e1057" name="xd25e1057">76</a>]</span>natural and good only for a
powerful great head was on him.</p>
<p>The mother had her own times minding the youngster. Evenly when he
was right big she&rsquo;d be lifting him out of the bed, at the morning
of the day, and fixing him up in a chair. There he&rsquo;d sit,
watching the fire until the fall of night, seemingly contented and in
the best of humour. He had great observation for all that would be
doing in the place, and if the least thing went astray he&rsquo;d have
an odious cor on him. The fire was his whole delight, when a turf fell
and the sparks flew he&rsquo;d open his mouth until you&rsquo;d swear
he was going to let a crow out of him. But never a sound came at
all.</p>
<p>It happened one time that Nallagh and the wife went to market,
leaving the servant boy and servant girl to mind the place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let you keep up a good fire for the youngster, the way he
will not be lonesome, and he looking on the glowing turf is his whole
delight. Let you attend to your business the same as if myself was
standing by to bid you do all things particular and tasty,&rdquo; says
the mistress, and she going out at the door. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1065" href="#xd25e1065" name=
"xd25e1065">77</a>]</span></p>
<p>Not a long were the two by their lone before they quit working and
began for to play themselves through the kitchen.</p>
<p>Says the servant boy: &ldquo;We&rsquo;d do well to be making a
little feast, considering herself is not in it, and the wee coley but a
silent creature will not be clashing on us at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that they brought the best of butter, cream and the like from
the dairy, and the girl mixed all in a meskin for to make a butter
cake. They built the fire with turf enough to roast the dinner of a
giant, set the pot-hooks in the ears of the pan and let down the crook
for to hang it on. &ldquo;With the help of the Living Powers,
that&rsquo;ll be the luscious bit,&rdquo; says the servant girl,
putting down the batter for to bake.</p>
<p>The whole time they were at their diversions Nallagh&rsquo;s child
never quit watching the pair. Maybe it&rsquo;s in expectation he was of
getting his taste of the feast.</p>
<p>The butter cake was doing nicely, turning a grand colour and a
lovely smell rising off it. The two heroes were in the best of humour,
chatting other and funning, when all of a sudden the servant boy
chanced to look out over the half door. &ldquo;I declare <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1077" href="#xd25e1077" name=
"xd25e1077">78</a>]</span>to man, we&rsquo;re destroyed
entirely,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;Himself and the mistress are
without!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sure enough it was Nallagh and the wife were after delaying in the
market but a short space only. The girl, hearing tell of them coming in
on her sooner nor they were expected, had the wit to whip the butter
cake off the fire, and she slipped it in under the chair where the
child was all times sitting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the queer old cor he&rsquo;s putting on his
countenance,&rdquo; says she. &ldquo;But what about it, considering he
is unable for to clash on us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that the father and mother came into the kitchen. And the four
near fell dead with wonderment and fear, for when he seen the parents
the wee lad cried out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hot, hot under my chair!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The servants were in odious dread, full sure they&rsquo;d be found
out and hunted from the place. For the butter cake was steaming mad
from the fire, and the child never quit shouting:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hot, hot under my chair!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t let another word out of him but only the one thing,
saying it maybe a hundred times after other:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hot, hot under my chair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, if he was to say it a hundred times, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1097" href="#xd25e1097" name=
"xd25e1097">79</a>]</span>or a thousand itself, Nallagh and the wife
could not know what in under the shining Heaven he was striving for to
tell. They were all of a tremblement with the wonder of the speech
coming to him, and they never thought to consider was there sense in
the words at all. It was a great miracle, surely, to hear the creature
that never made a sound before, and he roaring out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hot, hot under my chair!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old people were that put about they never thought to look round
the place to see was anything astray; and I promise you the two heroes
didn&rsquo;t ask to clash on themselves.</p>
<p>The whole house was left through other until the fall of night, and
every person in it was weary to the world with the dread and surprise
was on them. After dark the mother puts the son to bed, fixing him up
right comfortable. But it was not a sweet rest was laid out for the
people of that house.</p>
<p>In the darkness of the black midnight, a powerful great storm shook
the place. It was like as if the four winds of Heaven were striving
together, and they horrid vexed with one another. There were strange
noises in it too, music and shouting, the way it was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1108" href="#xd25e1108" name=
"xd25e1108">80</a>]</span>easy knowing the Good People were out playing
themselves, or maybe disputing in a war.</p>
<p>Thinking the child might be scared at the commotion, herself took a
light in her hand and went over to his bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is all well with you, sonny?&rdquo; says she, for she had a
fashion of speaking with him, evenly if it was no answers he&rsquo;d
give.</p>
<p>But the little fellow was not in it at all, he was away travelling
the world with the Fairy horsemen were after coming for him.</p>
<p>The whole disturbance died out as speedy and sudden as it came. The
music dwined in the far distance and the wind was still as the dawn of
a summer&rsquo;s day. Sure it was no right tempest at all but an old
furl blast the Good People had out for their diversion.</p>
<p>The child was never restored to Nallagh and the wife. The fairies
left them in peace from that out; they never heard the music on the
distant hills, nor the regiments of horsemen passing by. The whole time
it was lonesome they&rsquo;d be, and they looking on the empty chair
where the strange child delighted to sit silent, watching the turf was
glowing red. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1120" href="#xd25e1120"

<p>There was a strong farmer one time and he had nine beautiful cows
grazing on the best of land. Surely that was a great prosperity, and
you&rsquo;d be thinking him the richest man in all the countryside. But
it was little milk he was getting from his nine lovely cows, and no
butter from the milk. They&rsquo;d be churning in that house for three
hours or maybe for five hours of a morning, and at the end of all a few
wee grains of butter, the dead spit of spiders&rsquo; eggs, would be
floating on the top of the milk. Evenly that much did not remain to it,
for when herself ran the strainer in under them they melted from the
churn.</p>
<p>There were great confabulations held about the loss of the yield,
but the strength <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1131" href=
"#xd25e1131" name="xd25e1131">84</a>]</span>of the spoken word was
powerless to restore what was gone. Herself allowed that her man be to
have the evil eye, and it was overlooking his own cattle he was by
walking through them and he fasting at the dawn of day. The notion
didn&rsquo;t please him too well, indeed he was horrid vexed at her for
saying the like, but he went no more among the cows until after his
breakfast time. Sure that done no good at all&mdash;it was less and
less milk came in each day. And butter going a lovely price in the
market, to leave it a worse annoyance to have none for to sell.</p>
<p>The man of the house kept a tongue hound that was odious wise. The
two walked the cattle together, and it happened one day that they came
on a hare was running with the nine cows through the field. The hound
gave tongue and away with him after the hare, she making a great offer
to escape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe there is something in it,&rdquo; says the man to
himself. &ldquo;I have heard my old grandfather tell that hares
be&rsquo;s enchanted people; let it be true or no, I doubt
they&rsquo;re not right things in any case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that he set out for to follow his <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd25e1139" href="#xd25e1139" name="xd25e1139">85</a>]</span>tongue
hound, and the hunt went over the ditches and through the quick hedges
and down by the lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Begob it&rsquo;s odious weighty I am to be diverting myself
like a little gosoon,&rdquo; says the man. And indeed he was a big,
hearty farmer was leaving powerful gaps behind him where he burst
through the hedges.</p>
<p>There was a small, wee house up an old laneway, and that was where
the hunt headed for. The hare came in on the street not a yard in front
of the tongue hound, and she made a lep for to get into the cabin by a
hole on the wall convenient to the door. The hound got a grip of her
and she rising from the ground. But the farmer was coming up close
behind them and didn&rsquo;t he let a great crow out of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your hold, my bully boy! Hold your hold!&rdquo; The
tongue hound turned at the voice of the master calling, and the hare
contrived for to slip from between his teeth. One spring brought her in
on the hole in the wall, but she splashed it with blood as she passed,
and there was blood on the mouth of the hound.</p>
<p>The man came up, cursing himself for <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd25e1150" href="#xd25e1150" name="xd25e1150">86</a>]</span>spoiling
the diversion, but he was well determined to follow on. He took the
coat off his back and he stuffed it into the opening the way the hare
had no chance to get out where she was after entering, then he walked
round the house for to see was there any means of escape for what was
within. There wasn&rsquo;t evenly a space where a fly might contrive to
slip through, and himself was satisfied the hunt was shaping well.</p>
<p>He went to the door, and it was there the tongue hound went wild to
be making an entry, but a lock and a chain were upon it. The farmer
took up a stone and he broke all before him to get in after the hare
they followed so far.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old house is empty this long time,&rdquo; says he,
&ldquo;and evenly if I be to repair the destruction I make&mdash;sure
what is the price of a chain and a lock to a fine, warm man like
myself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that he pushed into the kitchen, and there was neither sight
nor sign of a hare to be found, but an old woman lay in a corner and
she bleeding.</p>
<p>The tongue hound gave the mournfullest whine and he juked to his
master&rsquo;s feet, it <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1160" href=
"#xd25e1160" name="xd25e1160">87</a>]</span>was easy knowing the beast
was in odious dread. The farmer gave a sort of a groan and he turned
for to go away home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a queer old diversion I&rsquo;m after
enjoying,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;Surely there&rsquo;s not a many in the
world do be hunting hares through the fields and catching old women are
bleeding to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he came to his own place the wife ran out of the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you look at the gallons of beautiful milk the cows are
after giving this day,&rdquo; says she, pulling him in on the door.</p>
<p>Sure enough from that out there was a great plenty of milk and a
right yield of butter on the churn. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<div class="divBody">
<p>There was once a man the name of Michael Hugh, and he was tormented
with dreams of a kist was buried in under a bridge in England. For
awhile he took no heed to the visions were with him in the stillness of
the night, but at long last the notion grew in his mind that he be to
visit that place and find out was there anything in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could make right use of a treasure,&rdquo; thinks he to
himself. &ldquo;For &rsquo;tis heart scalded I am with dwelling in
poverty, and a great weariness is on me from toiling for a miserable
wage.&rdquo; Then he bethought of the foolishness of making the journey
if all turned out a deceit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I&rsquo;ll be rid of belief in the dreams <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1183" href="#xd25e1183" name=
"xd25e1183">92</a>]</span>are driving me daft with their grandeur and
perseverance,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;Evenly failure will bring a sort
of satisfaction for I&rsquo;ll get fooling whatever spirit does be
bringing the vision upon me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So my brave Michael Hugh took an ash plant in his hand, and away
with him oversea to England to discover the bridge of the kist.</p>
<p>He was a twelvemonth travelling and rambling with no success to rise
his heart, and he began for to consider he had better return to his own
place. But just as he was making ready to turn didn&rsquo;t he chance
on a strong flowing river, and the sight near left his eyes when he
found it was spanned by the bridge he was after dreaming of.</p>
<p>Well Michael Hugh went over and he looked down on the black depth of
water was flowing in under the arch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be a hard thing surely to be digging for a kist
in that place,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking a man would
find a sore death and no treasure at all if he lepped into the flood.
But maybe it&rsquo;s laid out for me to gather my fortune here, and
some person may come for to give me instruction.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1193" href="#xd25e1193" name=
"xd25e1193">93</a>]</span></p>
<p>With that he walked up and down over the bridge, hoping for further
advice since he could not contrive a wisdom for his use. There was a
house convenient to the river, and after awhile a man came from it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you waiting on any person in this place?&rdquo; says he
to Michael Hugh. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s bitter weather to be abroad and you
be to be as hardy as a wild duck to endure the cold blast on the
bridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m hardy surely,&rdquo; Michael Hugh makes his answer.
&ldquo;But &rsquo;tis no easy matter to tell if I&rsquo;m waiting on
any person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re funning me,&rdquo; says the Englishman.
&ldquo;How would you be abroad without reason, and you having a
beautiful wise countenance on you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that Michael Hugh told him the story of the dreams that brought
him from Ireland, and how he was expectant of a sign to instruct him to
come at the kist. The Englishman let a great laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a simple fellow,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;Let you
give up heeding the like of visions and ghosts, for there is madness in
the same and no pure reason at all. There&rsquo;s few has more nor
better knowledge than myself of how <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd25e1207" href="#xd25e1207" name="xd25e1207">94</a>]</span>they be
striving to entice us from our work, but I&rsquo;m a reasonable man and
I never gave in to them yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might I make so free as to ask,&rdquo; says Michael Hugh,
&ldquo;what sort of a vision are you after resisting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you and welcome,&rdquo; says the Englishman.
&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t a night of my life but I hear a voice calling:
&lsquo;Away with you to Ireland, and seek out a man the name of Michael
Hugh. There is treasure buried in under a lone bush in his garden, and
that is in Breffny of Connacht.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poor Irishman was near demented with joy at the words, for he
understood he was brought all that journey to learn of gold was a
stone&rsquo;s throw from his own little cabin door.</p>
<p>But he was a conny sort of a person, and he never let on to the
other that Michael Hugh was the name of him, nor that he came from
Breffny of Connacht.</p>
<p>The Englishman invited him into his house for to rest there that
night, and he didn&rsquo;t spare his advice that dreams were a folly
and sin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have me convinced of the meaning <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1221" href="#xd25e1221" name=
"xd25e1221">95</a>]</span>of my visions,&rdquo; says Michael Hugh.
&ldquo;And what&rsquo;s more I&rsquo;ll go home as you bid
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next morning he started out, and he made great haste with the desire
was on him to get digging the gold.</p>
<p>When he came to his own place in Connacht he made straight for a loy
and then for the lone bush. Not a long was he digging before he hoked
out a precious crock full of treasure, and he carried it into the
house.</p>
<p>There was a piece of a flag stone lying on top of the gold, and
there was a writing cut into it. What might be the meaning of that
Michael Hugh had no notion, for the words were not Gaelic nor English
at all.</p>
<p>It happened one evening that a poor scholar came in for to make his
cailee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you read me that inscription, mister?&rdquo; asks Michael
Hugh, bringing out the flag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye surely,&rdquo; says the poor scholar. &ldquo;That is a
Latin writing, and I am well learned in the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What meaning is in it?&rdquo; asks the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;The same at the far side,&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;
says the scholar. &ldquo;And that is a droll saying surely when it
gives no information beyond.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd25e1240" href="#xd25e1240" name="xd25e1240">96</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it will serve my turn, mister!&rdquo; says Michael
Hugh, in the best of humour.</p>
<p>After the scholar was gone on his way, didn&rsquo;t himself take the
loy and out to the garden. He began for to dig at the far side of the
lone bush, and sure enough he found a second beautiful kist the dead
spit of the first.</p>
<p>It was great prosperity he enjoyed from that out. And he bought the
grandest of raiment, the way the neighbours began for to call him
Michael Hughie the Cock. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1247" href=

<p>There was a woman one time, and she had the fretfullest child in all
Ireland. He lay in the cradle and lamented from morning to night and
from dark to the dawn of day. There was no prosperity nor comfort in
that house from he came to it. All things went astray within in the
kitchen and without upon the farm: the cattle fell sick, the potatoes
took a blight, there was not a taste of butter on the churn, and evenly
the cat began for to dwine and dwine away. But of all the misfortunes
that come the woefullest was the continual strife between the man and
woman of the house, and they a couple that were horrid fond
aforetime.</p>
<p>It happened when the child was about <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd25e1258" href="#xd25e1258" name="xd25e1258">100</a>]</span>eighteen
months of age that a strange man was hired to work on the farm. Surely
he&rsquo;d never have ventured into the place if he had heard tell of
the ill luck was in it, but he was from distant parts and didn&rsquo;t
know a heth.</p>
<p>One day he chanced to be in from the work a while before the master
of the house, and herself was gone to the spring for water. The hired
man sat down by the kitchen fire, taking no heed of the child was
watching him from the cradle. The little fellow quit his lamenting; he
sat up straight, with a countenance on him like a wise old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will be playing you a tune on the fiddle, for I&rsquo;m
thinking &rsquo;tis fond of the music you are,&rdquo; says he.</p>
<p>The man near fell into the fire with wonderment to hear the
old-fashioned talk. He didn&rsquo;t say one word in answer, but he
waited to see what would be coming next.</p>
<p>The small weak infant pulled a fiddle out from under the pillow of
the cradle, and he began for to play the loveliest music was ever heard
in this world. He had reels and jigs, songs and sets; merry tunes would
rise the heart of man and mournful tunes would fill the mind with
grief. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1268" href="#xd25e1268" name=
"xd25e1268">101</a>]</span></p>
<p>The man sat listening, and he was all put through other, thinking
the child was no right thing.</p>
<p>After a time the little lad quit playing, he put back the fiddle
where he took it from and began at his old whimpering again. Herself
came in at the door with a bucket of water in her hand. Well the man
walked out and he called her after him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a strange child you have, mistress,&rdquo; says
he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A strange child, surely, and a sorrowful,&rdquo; she makes
answer. &ldquo;It is tormented with his roaring you are, no person
could be enduring it continually.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did ever he play on the fiddle in your hearing?&rdquo; asks
the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it raving you are?&rdquo; says she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not, mistress,&rdquo; he answers. &ldquo;He is after
giving me the best of entertainment with reels and marches and
jigs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let you quit funning me!&rdquo; says she, getting vexed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see you are doubting my words,&rdquo; he replies. &ldquo;Do
you stand here without where he&rsquo;ll not be looking on you at all.
I&rsquo;ll go <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1288" href=
"#xd25e1288" name="xd25e1288">102</a>]</span>into the kitchen, and
maybe he&rsquo;ll bring out the fiddle again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that he went in, leaving herself posted convenient to the
window.</p>
<p>Says he to the child, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking there&rsquo;s not
above a score of fiddlers in all Ireland having better knowledge of
music nor yourself. Sure that is a great wonder and you but an innocent
little thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s not that innocent I am,&rdquo; says the
child. &ldquo;And let me tell you there isn&rsquo;t one fiddler itself
to be my equal in the land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re boasting, you bold wee coley,&rdquo; says the
man.</p>
<p>The child sat up in a great rage, pulled the fiddle from under the
pillow and began for to play a tune was grander nor the lot he gave
first.</p>
<p>The man went out to herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you satisfied now?&rdquo; he asks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My heart beats time to his reels,&rdquo; says she. &ldquo;Run
down to the field and send the master to this place that he may hear
him too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man of the house came up in a terrible temper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s lies you are telling me, I&rsquo;ll brain the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1311" href="#xd25e1311" name=
"xd25e1311">103</a>]</span>pair of you with the loy,&rdquo; says he,
when he heard the news of the fiddle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put your ear to the window it&rsquo;s soft he is playing
now,&rdquo; says his wife.</p>
<p>But the words weren&rsquo;t out of her mouth before a blast of loud
music was heard. Himself ran in on the door, and he seen the gosoon
sitting up playing tunes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let you be off out of this,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;or
I&rsquo;ll throw you at the back of the fire, for you are no right
thing at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that the little fellow made a powerful great lep out of the
cradle, across the floor and away with him out over the fields.</p>
<p>But he left his fiddle behind, and the master of the house threw it
down on the burning turf. And that was no true fiddle at all, only a
piece of an old bog stick was rotten with age. <span class=

<p>There was a wild sort of a lad the name of Francis Pat, and he was a
great warrant to be entertaining the people with his airy talk. He was
the whole go in every spree and join was held in the countryside; and
the neighbours all had a fine welcome when he&rsquo;d come to make his
cailee.</p>
<p>He joined the world when he was about thirty years of age, and he
got a fine sensible woman with a nice little handful of money. Herself
didn&rsquo;t care to be rambling at all, and she&rsquo;d sit with her
stitching or knitting when he went out after dark.</p>
<p>It chanced one time, not a long from they were married, that Francis
Pat went to a raffle was held in the next townland. When <span class=

the black darkness of the night, every person in it was afraid to pass
down by the fort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is on you at all?&rdquo; says Francis Pat. &ldquo;I
think scorn on the lot of you are in dread of the Good
People.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God be with them&mdash;and their faces from us, their backs
to us, the way they&rsquo;re good friends,&rdquo; says an old man.
&ldquo;I have great experience to know that it&rsquo;s a danger to
evenly make fun in speech of the like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Away with you by the long hard road,&rdquo; says Francis Pat.
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis I will walk my lone past the fort, and I dare the
fairies to molest me.&rdquo; The neighbours strove to break his
intention, but he was persistent and proud.</p>
<p>When he came to the fort he seen a light, he heard voices speaking
and the blows of an axe against wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is one more daring nor myself abroad this hour,&rdquo;
thinks Francis Pat. &ldquo;I never heard tell of any person having
audacity to interfere with the trees of the circle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Curiosity came on him to know who could it be, and he juked over to
the light. He seen no sign of the men, however he peeped, but he heard
the words and the blows. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1351" href=
"#xd25e1351" name="xd25e1351">109</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;ll we carry the wood?&rdquo; says a voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the house on the hill,&rdquo; says another. &ldquo;We be
to bring out the wife of Francis Pat, and the tree may stop there in
her stead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll never know the differ,&rdquo; says the first.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fine thing surely to make an image from a tree that
a man couldn&rsquo;t know from herself.&rdquo; With that there was
great laughter and cheering, but the lad didn&rsquo;t wait to hear
more&mdash;he sped away home to the house on the hill.</p>
<p>Not a heth did he let on to the wife about what he was after
discovering, but he had a strong oath taken in his own mind that the
fairies should not lift her from him.</p>
<p>He bolted the door of the kitchen, and the two went into the room.
After awhile there came a cry on the street without, and it dwined away
into the byre. The cows began for to stamp and strive to get free of
the bails.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let you go out and see what ails the creatures,&rdquo; says
herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing on them,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
not leave this place till the sun rises for day.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1366" href="#xd25e1366" name=

<p>Then there came a powerful blast of wind, and the pigs set up the
awfullest lamentation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not that lazy but I&rsquo;ll find out what it
is,&rdquo; says herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll stop where you are,&rdquo; says he.
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you hear the blast going by, and every person knows
that pigs see the wind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever they&rsquo;re beholding this minute is a sore
distress to the creatures,&rdquo; she answers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye!&rdquo; he allows. &ldquo;The wind is red, and that is
the cause of them crying.&rdquo; There came a crash on the door of the
kitchen and it blew in; the plates were dashed off the dresser, and the
saucepans fell from the nails on the wall.</p>
<p>Francis Pat had to hold herself by the arm to keep her from running
to gather the delf. Voices came shouting, and there was a stamping of
feet through the house. The woman began for to cry and to roar, but
himself kept a hold on her and nothing enticed him away.</p>
<p>At dawn the commotion died out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was it at all?&rdquo; asks herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure what would it be only a wind was fit to batter the horns
off the cows!&rdquo; says Francis Pat. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p>When they went into the kitchen what did they find only the image
lying on the floor. The wood was cut into the living likeness of the
woman of the house, and the Good People had thrown it there in the
anger of the disappointment was on them.</p>

<p>There was a strong farmer one time and he was the boastfullest man
in all Ireland. He had a tidy, comfortable place, sure enough, but to
hear him speaking you&rsquo;d be thinking his house was built of silver
and thatched with the purest gold.</p>
<p>Herself was a very different sort of a person, kindly and
simple-hearted; she took no pleasure in making out she had more
property and grandeur than another body; and she was neither envious,
uncharitable, nor a clash.</p>
<p>The two had but one child, a daughter, and she was their whole
delight. Bride was a beautiful white girl with a countenance on her
would charm a king from his golden <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd25e1405" href="#xd25e1405" name="xd25e1405">116</a>]</span>throne to
be walking the bogs with herself. The boys were flocking after her by
the score, and she had but to raise her hand to draw any one of them to
her side. But, being a seemly, well-reared lass, she took her diversion
without any consideration of marriage at all&mdash;well satisfied her
father would be making a fitting settlement for her when the time
came.</p>
<p>The youth of the world will always be playing themselves and
chatting together, all the while them that have right wit and a good
upbringing do leave their settlement in the hands of the parents have
the best understanding for the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking,&rdquo; says himself one evening,
&ldquo;that it&rsquo;s old and stiff I am growing. It might be a
powerful advantage to take a son-in-law into the place, the way
I&rsquo;d get sitting in peace by the hearth, and he out in the fields
attending to the management of all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bride is full young to be joining the world,&rdquo; says his
wife. &ldquo;But I will not be putting any hindrance in the way of it,
for maybe it&rsquo;s better contented she&rsquo;d be to have a fine man
of her own, foreby to be looking <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

pair like ourselves, and we dozing by the fire of an
evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be making a little settlement for her,
surely,&rdquo; says himself.</p>
<p>The next day he gave out through the country that Bride was to be
married. What with the little handful of money, the fine farm of land
and the looks of the girl, the suitors were coming in plenty. There
were strong farmers, small farmers, tradesmen and dealers; a cow
doctor, a blacksmith, and evenly a man that travelled in tea. Himself
was disgusted with all; he put out the farmers and dealers very civil
and stiff, but the tea man he stoned down the road for a couple of
miles.</p>
<p>The next suitor to come was a beautiful young lad the name of Shan
Alec. He was a tasty worker, and he had the best of good money was left
him by his da. Now if you were to seek all Ireland ten times through,
I&rsquo;ll go bail you wouldn&rsquo;t be finding a more suitable match
nor Shan Alec and Bride. The girl and her mother were fair wild with
delight, but they got an odious disappointment for didn&rsquo;t himself
run the poor boy out of the house. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised at you,&rdquo; says the wife. &ldquo;Why
couldn&rsquo;t you have wit and give that decent lad an honourable
reception?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it to give my daughter to yon country coley?&rdquo; says
he. &ldquo;And I the warmest man in these parts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A better match for her like isn&rsquo;t walking this
earth,&rdquo; says the wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your whisht, woman,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
sooner let the devil have her than see her join the world with Shan
Alec.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is on you at all to be speaking such foolishness?&rdquo;
asks herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have you to know,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;that
I&rsquo;ll have a gentleman for my son-in-law and no common person at
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the raving of prosperity is on you,&rdquo; says she.
&ldquo;And that is the worst madness out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak easy,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;or maybe I&rsquo;ll
correct you with the pot stick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that she allowed he be to be gone daft entirely, or he&rsquo;d
never have such an unseemly thought as to raise his hand to a
woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your whisht,&rdquo; he answers. &ldquo;Surely &rsquo;tis
both hand and foot I&rsquo;ll be giving you unless you quit
tongueing.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1443" href=
"#xd25e1443" name="xd25e1443">119</a>]</span></p>
<p>Not a long afterwards a splendid gentleman came to the house, and he
riding on a horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard tell,&rdquo; says he to the farmer, &ldquo;that
you are seeking a suitable settlement for your daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If your honour wants a wife,&rdquo; says himself. &ldquo;Let
you be stepping in, for it&rsquo;s maybe in this house you&rsquo;ll
find her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that the gentleman got down off his horse, and it was an
honourable reception they made him. Evenly herself was content to
remember the scorn put on poor Shan Alec, when she seen the magnificent
suitor was come.</p>
<p>The gentleman had a smile on his face when he heard all the boasts
of the farmer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My good man,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I think scorn on your
money and land, for I&rsquo;d have you to know that I am a King in my
own place. But that girl sitting by the hearth has a lovely white
countenance on her, and her heart I am seeking for love of the
same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh mother,&rdquo; says Bride in a whisper, &ldquo;will you
send him away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it raving you are?&rdquo; asks herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d go through fire and water for my poor Shan
Alec!&rdquo; says Bride. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1463" href=
"#xd25e1463" name="xd25e1463">120</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you hold your whisht,&rdquo; says her mother.
&ldquo;That is no right talk for a well-reared girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The farmer and the gentleman made their agreement and opened the
bottle of whiskey. There was to be a nice little feast for to celebrate
the settlement, and the cloth was set in the parlour on account of the
grandeur of the suitor and he not used to a kitchen at all.</p>
<p>When the supper was served didn&rsquo;t the servant girl call the
mistress out to the kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh mam,&rdquo; says she. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t get word
with you in private before. Let you hunt that lad from the
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why, might I ask?&rdquo; says herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure how would he be a right gentleman and he having a foot
on him like a horse?&rdquo; says the girl.</p>
<p>With that the mistress began to lament and to groan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll I do! What&rsquo;ll I do, and I scared useless
with dread?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go in and impeach him,&rdquo; says the servant
girl.</p>
<p>In she went to the parlour. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1485"
href="#xd25e1485" name="xd25e1485">121</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Quit off out of this,&rdquo; says she. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
have no horse feet in this place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The master got up to run her from the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look under the table at your lovely gentleman&rsquo;s
foot!&rdquo; says she.</p>
<p>The farmer done as she bid, but he was that set in his own conceit
he just answers:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What harm is in a reel foot? It&rsquo;s no ornament surely,
but that&rsquo;s all there is to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many&rsquo;s the reel foot I&rsquo;ve laid eyes on,&rdquo;
she says. &ldquo;But yon is the hoof of a horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s truth you are speaking,&rdquo; says the gentleman.
&ldquo;I am the devil and no person less.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quit off from here,&rdquo; says the servant. &ldquo;A decent
girl, like us two, need never be fearing your like. I&rsquo;d hit you a
skelp with the pot stick as soon as I&rsquo;d stand on a
worm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t put me out,&rdquo; says the devil. &ldquo;For
the man of the house has me promised his daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no person living,&rdquo; says Bride, &ldquo;might
have power on the soul of another. If my sins don&rsquo;t deliver me
into your hand the word of my da is no use.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1507" href="#xd25e1507" name=
"xd25e1507">122</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll be taking himself,&rdquo; says the devil,
making ready to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may wait till he&rsquo;s dead,&rdquo; cries the woman of
the house. &ldquo;He made you no offer of his bones and his
flesh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tongues of three women would argue the devil to
death,&rdquo; says he, and away with him in a grey puff of smoke. The
man and woman of the house began for to pray. But says Bride to the
servant:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let you slip off to Shan Alec and bid him come up&mdash;for
it&rsquo;s maybe an honourable reception is waiting him here.&rdquo;

<div class="divBody">
<p>There was a man in these parts, and he thought it hard to see a
square inch of ground go to loss. He had a small wee farm on the top of
a windy hill, and there was a fort on the sweetest of the fields. He
couldn&rsquo;t pass by but he&rsquo;d think of how much potatoes might
be grown within in the circle. Well with the dint of consideration
didn&rsquo;t he finally decide for to plant it.</p>
<p>He never let on to his wife, but away out with the loy, and he made
great work before the fall of night. When he came in he carried a
lengthy thorn root in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you holding?&rdquo; asks herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An old thorn I hoked out of the ground,&rdquo; says he.
&ldquo;I brought it in for the fire.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1531" href="#xd25e1531" name=
"xd25e1531">126</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it making gaps in the quick hedges you are?&rdquo; she
asks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;I have the circle beyond
rooted up for to set potatoes in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it the fort!&rdquo; says she.</p>
<p>When she heard what he was after doing she began for to roar and to
cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is destroyed we are in this ill hour,&rdquo; she lamented.
&ldquo;The Good People will be following us surely with the black wrath
of vengeance and spite. Never before did I hear of a man setting spuds
in a fort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quit raving,&rdquo; says he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many and many&rsquo;s the time I have seen them, they riding
down by the hill; their fiddles and fifes I have heard, their shouts
and their laughs. But I had no cause for a dread till it come on me
now,&rdquo; she replies.</p>
<p>With that herself took the thorn from the fire, where he was after
casting it down; she left it out on the door of the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let their branch stop beyond on the street,&rdquo; says she,
&ldquo;the way they will not be entering here and they seeking for to
bring it away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the black darkness of midnight there came the awfullest cry on
the street, on past <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1553" href=
"#xd25e1553" name="xd25e1553">127</a>]</span>the house and into the
byre. Then a great lamentation came from the cows and the ass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The creatures are a killing this night,&rdquo; says
herself.</p>
<p>The man rose out of his bed and he kindled a light. He had the heart
to go out to the beasts to see what ailed them at all. There was no
loss on the cows nor the ass, and the cry and the shouting were
gone.</p>
<p>He went back to the house, but not a long was he in before the very
same trouble rose in the byre. Out with him again to make sure what was
wrong, and he found not a single heth astray.</p>
<p>He was back in his bed when a third cry passed on the wind. The ass
let a roar was more nor horrid lonesome, and the cows were stamping and
roaring with dread. All the while there was nothing in it when the
master went out.</p>
<p>There was no sound more until hard on the break of day. A laugh that
was hateful to hear passed the house, and a hand struck hard on the
window.</p>
<p>Himself rose early, and he opened the door. What did he see only the
ass lying dead on <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1568" href=
"#xd25e1568" name="xd25e1568">128</a>]</span>the street, and the two
cows were destroyed in the byre.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas the fairies, surely,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;And
they brought this destruction upon me for hoking a hole in their
farm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a powerful great price they&rsquo;re after
charging you for the hire of a small piece of ground,&rdquo; says
herself, coming out. &ldquo;But the thorn stick is gone off the street
where I threw it last night, and if that had remained in the house
they&rsquo;d have murdered ourselves.&rdquo; <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p>Of all the contrivances of the art and learning of man there is none
more curious nor cards. They have a connection with beings are not
right things at all, and it is well known that an Evil Angel can house
himself for a while in a new deck of cards.</p>
<p>There was a young lad called Terry the Luck, and he a great warrant
for gaining all games of skill and of chance. He was that strongly
renowned the roulette men would warn him away from their boards in a
fair, and the thimble trick man fled clean from the street when he
come; the gosoons were in dread to toss pence with himself for the coin
fell head or tail as he called.</p>
<p>Now it happened one night that Terry the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1587" href="#xd25e1587" name=
"xd25e1587">132</a>]</span>Luck was on his way home from the sports,
and he carried a new deck of cards in his hand. He was in the best of
humour for he was after winning a powerful bet on a race. Part of the
gain was snug in his pocket, and the remainder had paid for the drink
of his friends and himself.</p>
<p>The road to his home was lonely, for he lived in a backward
townland. The river passed within sight of his door, and it spanned by
a bridge was four arches long.</p>
<p>When Terry the Luck set his foot on the bridge didn&rsquo;t he wheel
away round and start in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a strange thing,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;Sure my
legs were right steady till now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that he went at it again, but he couldn&rsquo;t succeed for to
cross. He went back about twenty yards and took a run at it&mdash;that
was no use either. Well any person that seen his antics that night
would have died of the laughter. Back he&rsquo;d go and race up to the
bridge for all he was worth, but whenever his foot came upon it
he&rsquo;d turn like a leaf on the wind and away to where he started
from. What was more nor horrid vexatious for the poor fellow was to see
the light shining <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1597" href=
"#xd25e1597" name="xd25e1597">133</a>]</span>in his own kitchen window
beyond, and he not fit to get home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis enchanted I am,&rdquo; says he.</p>
<p>At long last he thought of the new deck of cards, and he laid them
down by the roadside before he made another attempt to go home. He
passed the bridge without the least hindrance, but when he went into
the house he began to consider it was all a foolishness only.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What use is there in laying out money for cards, and throwing
them there to be rotting with damp?&rdquo; says he.</p>
<p>Back he went across the river to fetch the new deck of cards. But if
he was to strive till he died of exhaustion he couldn&rsquo;t get over
the bridge and they in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lay them in under a stone until dawn,&rdquo; says
he. &ldquo;Maybe whatever is in them will quit before then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he settled his cards in a safe hiding hole, and away with him to
his bed.</p>
<p>He rose with the early dawn for to bring out the deck. But there
wasn&rsquo;t a heth to be found where he stowed it away&mdash;and the
earth by the stone was all burnt into ash. <span class=

<p>There was a woman, a short while since, and she lived on a snug
little farm convenient to the lough. She went to the byre for to milk,
of a May morning, and no person stopped in the house only a young child
in the cradle.</p>
<p>Not a long was herself without, maybe the half of an hour, and when
she came in there was no appearance of any disorder or strife in the
kitchen. But the poor wee child lay cold and dead in the cradle. The
mother began for to roar and lament, and her heart was feeble with
dread.</p>
<p>There came a knock on the door, and a neighbouring man lifted the
latch and walked in. He never let on to observe the woeful <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1627" href="#xd25e1627" name=
"xd25e1627">138</a>]</span>countenance of herself, but he says, in a
hearty voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you tell me how is the child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is after dying on us,&rdquo; she answers. &ldquo;And he
right well this hour past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man went over to the cradle, and he lepped three foot off the
floor when he seen the wee corpse lying there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the strangest thing at all,&rdquo; she laments.
&ldquo;And what&rsquo;ll I be saying to himself when he lands in from
his work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let you be telling him,&rdquo; says the man, &ldquo;that the
little fellow is in my house this day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis queer advice you are speaking to be bidding me
utter the like of yon lie, forenenst the innocent corpse,&rdquo; says
herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a lie in the world, mam,&rdquo; he answers. &ldquo;Sure I
am just after leaving your child by my own kitchen fire, and he wrapped
up in a shawl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that she took a hold of the pot stick for to run him from the
place&mdash;she was odious vexed to think he&rsquo;d make mock of her
sore lamentations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ar&rsquo;n&rsquo;t you the ungrateful besom,&rdquo; says he,
&ldquo;to go destroying a decent neighbour <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1648" href="#xd25e1648" name=
"xd25e1648">139</a>]</span>with a pot stick, and he after saving your
son from the power of the Good People?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let you tell a straight story, or quit off from here,&rdquo;
she answers. &ldquo;For I am heart scalded listening to your old
nonsense and lies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis striving I was not to give you your death of a
scare,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;But the strangest thing is after coming
to pass in this house. Let you sit down and have good courage, the way
I&rsquo;ll be telling you a rejoiceful news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that herself brought him over a chair, dusting it clean on her
apron, then she pulled up the creepy and sat down to attend to his
words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hear any noise of disturbance,&rdquo; says he,
&ldquo;wherever you were?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not,&rdquo; she answers. &ldquo;And not a far was I
from this place at all. I went to the byre for to milk; and no noise
was in it only the cow breathing and the splash of the milk in the
can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s more nor horrid strange,&rdquo; says he.
&ldquo;For I was passing down by the lough and I heard a powerful
commotion up here. There was laughter and cheering, the tramp of
men&rsquo;s boots on the street, and horses galloping by. Thinks I to
myself, &lsquo;The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1662" href=
"#xd25e1662" name="xd25e1662">140</a>]</span>fairies are out contriving
some old villainy this morning of May.&rsquo; What did I do only walk
up among them, and I seen no person at all. When I came to the house
the poor wee child was a handing out on the window, but I could not
behold the fairies were at the lifting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well I&rsquo;d have you to know I&rsquo;m a brave and
venturesome man, with a heart as strong as an eagle! What did I do only
make my way in among the whole throng of Good People, and I standing on
their feet, and pushing them off to the wall to make space for myself.
I took a hold of the child for to pull him from the invisible hands
were lifting him out, and, as sure as I&rsquo;m sitting here, I brought
him safe from the lot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There went a whole roar of annoyance from the fairies, and
they mounted up on their horses and away. But I brought the little
fellow to my own house for fear they&rsquo;d return for him to this
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poor mother was wild with delight to hear tell the son was
alive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s be going to fetch him,&rdquo; says she.
&ldquo;And he&rsquo;ll never be left in the house by his lone from this
out.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1673" href="#xd25e1673"
name="xd25e1673">141</a>]</span></p>
<p>The two went down to the neighbour&rsquo;s house, and sure enough
the child was in it asleep by the fire.</p>
<p>The man had to carry him home, for herself was exhausted with
fright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe the Good People are gone up to remove what they left in
the cradle,&rdquo; says she.</p>
<p>But when they went into the kitchen wasn&rsquo;t the old corpse in
it yet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We be to bury yon article,&rdquo; says herself. But the man
allowed there was no need to be treating the like the same as a right
thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Throw it in on the back of the fire,&rdquo; says he.</p>
<p>Herself was in dread to lay her hand on the likeness of the child.
So the man lifted it out of the cradle and threw it down on the fire.
And it blazed away up the chimney for a second&rsquo;s time and
departed in a puff of smoke. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1688"

<p>There was one time a poor widow woman he name of Cathleen the
Hollow, for her house was down in a dip of the ground. She had two fine
beautiful sons, Shan the Hollow and Hughie Cathleen. Shan was a dancer
could step on a plate and not put a break in the delf; and Hughie could
sing every ballad and song was ever heard tell of at all.</p>
<p>They were wild daring lads, too, the way there was great talk of
them in the countryside. And the lamentations of the youth of the world
were more nor a fright when news came round to the neighbours that
Hughie was dead.</p>
<p>He lay down of a Friday night, and he <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd25e1701" href="#xd25e1701" name="xd25e1701">146</a>]</span>in the
best of health, on the Saturday morning the brother went to rouse him,
and found him perished dead.</p>
<p>Well there was a most elegant wake, not a one in those parts but
paid respect to the corpse. And there wasn&rsquo;t the least suspicion
but that Hughie come by his death of some natural cause.</p>
<p>It was maybe a fortnight after the burying that the sleep quit Shan
the Hollow entirely. If evenly he began for to doze in his bed
he&rsquo;d be roused up again by a rap on the door&mdash;but when he
stepped out there was no person visible there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh mother,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking poor
Hughie is walking the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is not,&rdquo; says she. &ldquo;For he was a decent lad
would find peace in the grave. But there is some person making free
with this house, for not a day goes by but I miss some article of
food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shan let it be, but his mind was uneasy for Hugh. And not a long
after he heard a voice go past in the night, and it singing a beautiful
song. He rose and he went to the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh Hughie,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;is that your spirit
travelling the earth?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1716"
href="#xd25e1716" name="xd25e1716">147</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s myself is walking the world, and I not buried at
all,&rdquo; says the voice. &ldquo;The Good People have me away, and
the corpse was an old image cut from bog stick that they left in my bed
to deceive you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s yourself is using the food from this house,
my poor boy?&rdquo; says Shan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, indeed,&rdquo; says the voice, &ldquo;and sometimes
it&rsquo;s little I find. It does be hard on me to refuse the noble
refreshment the fairies set out, but if I&rsquo;d eat of the like I
could never escape from their power. Do you tell herself to leave me a
mug of sweet milk and a morsel of bread on the sill of the window, to
keep me from hungering more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have the best in the house left ready against
you come,&rdquo; says Shan. &ldquo;But will you tell me what way am I
to contrive a rescue?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy enough,&rdquo; says the voice. &ldquo;But
I&rsquo;m diverting myself with the fairies, and I&rsquo;ll not be
coming home for a while. They took me out oversea to America and showed
me the wonders are there. Sure maybe it&rsquo;s in France I&rsquo;ll be
at the dawning of day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d liefer sit by our own fireside than travel the
realms of the world with their like,&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1729" href="#xd25e1729" name=
"xd25e1729">148</a>]</span>says Shan. &ldquo;Let you give them the slip
and come home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I seen the King&rsquo;s daughter of Spain, and a Queen of the
East,&rdquo; says the voice. &ldquo;For let me be telling you
there&rsquo;s few like myself with the fairies, the way they are
showing me great respect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shan gets vexed at the words and he says: &ldquo;Is it boasting
forenenst your own brother you are? Sure we come of a poor stock of
people, and I have heard tell there are lords of the
fairies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my singing has them crazed about me,&rdquo; says
the voice, &ldquo;for they have right understanding for music and
songs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there any man or woman of these parts excepting yourself
abroad with them now?&rdquo; asks Shan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a one at this present. But at dark to-morrow we are going
for to lift young Cassidy&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well Shan kept inquiring of Hughie when would he like to come home.
At long last the lad gave out he&rsquo;d be ready in three weeks from
that hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let you come to the fort,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;and meet the
whole host of the fairies. We&rsquo;ll <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd25e1746" href="#xd25e1746" name="xd25e1746">149</a>]</span>give them
the slip at the gap.&rdquo; With that the voice went away off the
street, singing till the sound dwined out in the distance. But my poor
Shan was that put about he couldn&rsquo;t decide what to do. At the
dawn of the morning he set off to visit the Priest, and he informed him
every word he was after hearing. Well his Reverence couldn&rsquo;t
believe there was anything in it only a dream of the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let your Reverence go to the Cassidy&rsquo;s and keep herself
from their hands,&rdquo; says Shan. &ldquo;For the Good People are
determined to lift her away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go home now and attend to your farm,&rdquo; says the Priest.
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis the raving of grief is on you for the brother you
lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still and all his Reverence set out for Cassidy&rsquo;s that evening
to see was anything wrong. Didn&rsquo;t he find the Good People before
him and they had herself brought away. &ldquo;Oh if only I had come in
time,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;But I might be some hindrance to them
yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that he went down to the hollow, and Shan was sitting within in
the house. Says the Priest: &ldquo;Let you not stir from this for the
calling of voices that pass. You are <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd25e1756" href="#xd25e1756" name="xd25e1756">150</a>]</span>after
informing me of an intention you have for to rescue your brother on a
set and certain night. Now give me your promise to make no attempt of
the sort&mdash;for it&rsquo;s into the power of the fallen angels
you&rsquo;d go, and you&rsquo;d not get him rescued at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I be to make an offer anyway,&rdquo; says Shan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; says the Priest. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send
four strong men of this parish to rope you down in your bed on that ill
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t they hold my poor Shan from his offer to bring home the
brother, and surely it was well done for his own destruction was in it.
But the voice came no more to the window and the bread lay uncut on the
sill. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1764" href="#xd25e1764" name=

<div class="divBody">
<p>When the Good People fell from the Heavens above, didn&rsquo;t some
of them sink in the sea, and there they are dwelling this day.</p>
<p>Many and many a story is told of their diversions and how they be
wrecking the ships; but the strangest account I ever heard tell was the
fisherman&rsquo;s daughter that met the Earl&rsquo;s son of the
sea.</p>
<p>She was travelling the sands by her lone, on the west coast of
Ireland, and when she came near to the rocks she heard the notes of a
harp. Of course she was curious to know who was out playing in that
place and no dwelling near; so over she went towards the sound, and
what did she come on only a beautiful yellow-haired man. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1777" href="#xd25e1777" name=
"xd25e1777">154</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s destroyed in a short space you&rsquo;ll be,&rdquo;
she calls out, &ldquo;for the tide is beginning to rise and
you&rsquo;ll be dashed dead on the rocks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know who I am?&rdquo; says he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not,&rdquo; she answers. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re surely
a stranger to these parts or you wouldn&rsquo;t sit there with the
waves beginning to rise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I travelled this bay before you were born,&rdquo; says
he.</p>
<p>With that she let a laugh out of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking the two of us are about the one
age,&rdquo; says she. &ldquo;So quit your old-fashioned talk and come
on out of that till I show you the way up the cliff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a beautiful girl,&rdquo; says the stranger,
&ldquo;and the wish is on me to please you. Climb up out of reach of
the rising sea and I&rsquo;ll play you a tune on the harp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well she travelled back over the sand and up by the path to the
cliff, never doubting but the stranger was following on. But when she
looked down she seen him below on the rock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is drownded you&rsquo;ll be,&rdquo; she calls out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let you not be uneasy,&rdquo; says he.</p>
<p>With that he began for to play on the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd25e1801" href="#xd25e1801" name="xd25e1801">155</a>]</span>harp, and
the music enchanted the fisherman&rsquo;s child and the tears ran down
from her eyes. When she looked again to the rock wasn&rsquo;t the
stranger washed from it and a big white wave curled up from the
place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m after finding and losing a beautiful boy,&rdquo;
says she, and she went away home lamenting his death.</p>
<p>Not a long after she was travelling the sands, and she heard the
music again. There was himself sitting up on the rock as sound as a
salmon at play.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt you&rsquo;re no right thing,&rdquo; says she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe not,&rdquo; he allows. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll rise your
heart with a tune&mdash;if it was crying I had you the last time
it&rsquo;s laughing I&rsquo;ll see you this day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that he played the cleverest dancing tune on the harp, and he
had the fisherman&rsquo;s daughter in the best of humour.</p>
<p>After a while he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking you have a poor way
of living in your home, for it&rsquo;s hard set to earn a bit and a sup
that the fishermen are in this place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re miserable, surely,&rdquo; she answers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be making you a great advancement,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1820" href="#xd25e1820" name=
"xd25e1820">156</a>]</span>says he. &ldquo;For I&rsquo;d have you to
know that there&rsquo;s plenty of wealth in my power. Let you quit from
your own friends and marry myself. It&rsquo;s a beautiful castle
I&rsquo;ll build you, out on a rock in the ocean, and jewels and pearls
for your portion to wear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lonesome life,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;to be watching the
wild birds fly over the waves, and maybe a ship passing by. Moreover
you are no right thing, evenly if you have the appearance of a
beautiful gentleman. It&rsquo;s a poor man of these parts will join the
world with myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I&rsquo;m an Earl&rsquo;s son of the sea,&rdquo; he
allows.</p>
<p>But the grandeur didn&rsquo;t tempt her at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sea marriage would be no marriage,&rdquo; she answers, and
with that she bid him good-day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let your man never travel the sea,&rdquo; he answers,
&ldquo;for I&rsquo;ll destroy the ship from under his feet and leave
him dead on a wave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He lepped down into the water and away with him from out of her
sight.</p>
<p>The fisherman&rsquo;s daughter never heard him out harping again,
nor seen a sight of his face. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1836"
href="#xd25e1836" name="xd25e1836">157</a>]</span>And after a while she
forgot the queer lad entirely. Didn&rsquo;t she marry a farmer inland,
and it was a comfortable life they enjoyed.</p>
<p>But a notion took himself that he&rsquo;d prosper more in the
States, for he was greedy for gold. He took passage for the two on a
great big ship, and away with them from Ireland.</p>
<p>Not a long were they at sea before a sudden furl blast met the ship,
and a wave twenty times as high as a house stood up over the deck and
broke down. Every person was killed dead and smashed into the wood of
the ship only the fisherman&rsquo;s daughter. She felt the vessel sink
down from under her and she looked up and seen a beautiful castle rise
up on a rock on the sea.</p>
<p>The Earl&rsquo;s son came past on a wave and he lifted her up by the
hair of her head for to land her out on the rock.</p>
<p>The fisherman&rsquo;s daughter lived in that place for fourteen
years and she lamenting the lonesome hours of each day. She seen the
wild gulls flying and whales and every sort sailing the waves. She took
no delight in the jewels nor the dresses were stored in that house, and
the Earl&rsquo;s son of the sea allowed she grew ugly and old.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1847" href="#xd25e1847" name=
"xd25e1847">158</a>]</span></p>
<p>It happened one day he was travelling in other parts that herself
seen a ship coming down, and she waved a white flag out the window.</p>
<p>A man came out from the ship in a small little boat, and who was it
only her own brother Michael.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh sister dear,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;is it sitting on a
rock you are for fourteen weary years? Sure we heard tell of the loss
of the vessel was bringing you out to the States.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fine castle is here,&rdquo; says she. &ldquo;But
it&rsquo;s lonesome I am for my home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see no more nor a rock and it green with the weed of the
sea,&rdquo; says Michael. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s on your eyes that
there&rsquo;s more in it, for I see nothing at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that she told him the whole story. And he was in dread for to
bring her away lest the Earl&rsquo;s son might destroy them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; says he.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s back to Ireland I&rsquo;ll sail, and I&rsquo;ll get
an image made the down likeness of yourself. When we set that up on the
rock himself will believe you are in it, and we may get
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he rowed his wee boat to the ship and home he sailed to Ireland.
He got the finest <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1864" href=
"#xd25e1864" name="xd25e1864">159</a>]</span>image made, and it the
dead spit of herself. With that in his keeping he travelled the sea
till he came to the rock and his sister still sat there lamenting. But
she had a red flag hung out and that was the sign they&rsquo;d agreed
for him not to come near. So he be to wait until she put up a white
one, and then he knew that the Earl&rsquo;s son was not near.</p>
<p>He got her safe to the boat, and they left the old image stuck up on
the rock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s two little fellows like sea-monkeys he&rsquo;s
left to watch when he&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; says herself. &ldquo;But
they didn&rsquo;t see me slip out and they&rsquo;ll never think but the
statue is me. I haven&rsquo;t the least fear of them bringing him word
there is anything wrong, but if he returns we are lost for he
won&rsquo;t be that easy deceived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They made great sailing to Ireland, and the ship was coming in on
the harbour the way they were sure they&rsquo;d come safe. What did
they see only the Earl&rsquo;s son and he riding on a big white wave to
catch up to them. The image was with him, and he threw it after the
ship the way a hole was cleft in her side and she sank. But the
fisherman&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1873" href=
"#xd25e1873" name="xd25e1873">160</a>]</span>daughter, her brother, and
the sailors got on shore in a boat before he came at them again.</p>
<p>They seen him from the shore, and he flittering something with his
two hands. What was it only the sea-monkeys, and he threw the bits of
them up on the shore. He came in himself, but they pelted him from it
with stones for his power was lost on the land.</p>
<p>But not a one of that family to this present day may venture into
the waves, for the Earl&rsquo;s son watches out to destroy them for
vengeance and spite. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1879" href=

<p>There was a beautiful young girl living in these parts, and she was
greatly admired by every person that seen her.</p>
<p>It happened when she was about nineteen years of age that she
fainted one day on the street before the house, where she was washing
the spuds for dinner. The mother and sister went out for to carry her
in, and they laid her down on the bed&mdash;the poor girl never rose
from it more. Maybe a week she was lingering dying, not a word ever
came from her lips and she used no food at all.</p>
<p>Not a long after the burying her mother heard a rapping on the
window, close upon midnight. She rose and she says, &ldquo;Oh Bridget
dear, is it you?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1892" href=
"#xd25e1892" name="xd25e1892">164</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;It is indeed, mamma,&rdquo; says a voice. &ldquo;Let you give
me a drink of sweet milk and a small taste of bread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard tell of the dead were uneasy, but never of
one needing food,&rdquo; says the mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fairies have me away,&rdquo; answers Bridget.
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis myself is living this day, and you are after giving
decent burial to an old thing they left in my place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that the poor mother brought milk and bread to the window and
handed it out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you ever contrive to get home, my poor Bridget?&rdquo;
says she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye surely,&rdquo; answers the girl, &ldquo;if the men of
this place are worthy their keep. Let you make inquiries among them
until you find two strong daring boys are willing to attempt my
rescue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went away off the street, and the mother went back to her
bed.</p>
<p>The next evening there were some of the neighbours came in, and
herself gave out all she was after hearing. There were two clever lads
in it and they promised for to bring the girl snug and safe to her
home.</p>
<p>Not a long after Bridget came back to the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1912" href="#xd25e1912" name=
"xd25e1912">165</a>]</span>window to speak with the mother, so when she
heard of the offer was made she says: &ldquo;The Good People are going
away over the moor on Wednesday night and I must journey with them. It
is mounted on horses we&rsquo;ll be, and tell the two lads I told them
to stand by the gap and watch for the squad going through. I&rsquo;ll
be upon the third grey horse to go by, and let the two lads take a hold
of me, one at each side. Now if they&rsquo;re not full sure
they&rsquo;ll have courage and daring to hold their hold, let them not
come near me at all. For if I pass on with the fairies they&rsquo;ll
kill me dead for vengeance that night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mother promised she&rsquo;d give the lads great warning to keep
their hold and do all as Bridget was saying.</p>
<p>Well on the Wednesday night the venturesome lads went down to the
gap of the fort field, and there they stood waiting one at each side of
the pass. Not a long were they in it before the Good People began to go
through. One grey horse went down beside another and a third came
behind with Bridget sitting upon his back.</p>
<p>The two lads caught a hold of her, but <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd25e1920" href="#xd25e1920" name=
"xd25e1920">166</a>]</span>didn&rsquo;t the horse let a stag lep and
they lost their grip on the girl. She gave the lonesomest cry as she
was carried from them, and the fairies began for to cheer and to
laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll follow the Good People on,&rdquo; says one of the
boys, &ldquo;and maybe we&rsquo;ll vanquish them yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the two travelled after the riders, away towards the moor. The
river flows convenient to that place, and a fine bridge spans it
across. It was there that the awfullest cry rose out of the throng of
the fairies, and when the boys came on to the bridge they seen it all
red with my poor Bridget&rsquo;s blood. The horsemen were after dashing
her down on the stones to her death. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p>There was a big gathering of neighbours sitting round a fire,
telling stories of an evening, and some person says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the strongest bolt and lock in all Ireland on
the door there beyond, and it couldn&rsquo;t be broken at
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that the Good People were listening outside began for to laugh.
Didn&rsquo;t they whip the lock off the door and away with them through
the fields.</p>
<p>Says the man of the house: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking there&rsquo;s
danger abroad; let the lot of you stop here till dawn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But there was a big, venturesome man in it and he allowed he&rsquo;d

<p>He started off by his lone, and he had a wet sort of field to pass
through with a great shaking scraw to one side. It was an awful and
dangerous place to any person not used to the like, but he knew his way
by the pass.</p>
<p>He was travelling at a good speed when all on a sudden he heard the
tramping of a score of horses behind him. Then they came up round
himself, but he seen no person at all nor a sign of a horse or an
ass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fairies are in it,&rdquo; says he.</p>
<p>With that one of them took a hold of him by the collar and turned
him round on the path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-night, my brave Michael,&rdquo; says the horsemen.</p>
<p>Then another of them took him by the shoulder and faced him away
round again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-night, my brave Michael,&rdquo; says he. Well the whole
score of fairies kept turning him round until he seen the stars
dropping down from the sky and his ears were deafened with a sound like
the sea. And every one that took him by the shoulder would say:
&ldquo;Good-night, my brave Michael, good-night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poor fellow didn&rsquo;t know what in <span class=

seen they were setting him astray, but he couldn&rsquo;t continue for
to keep on the path, and he was in odious dread they&rsquo;d furl him
into the shaking scraw where he&rsquo;d sink from the sight of man.</p>
<p>A sudden thought struck his mind of a saying he heard from his ma.
He whipped the coat off his back and he put it on with the wrong side
turned out. And then he found he was standing alone in the field, on
the edge of the scraw, and no person near him at all. So he went away
home without any mishap, but indeed he was trembling with dread.

<p>There was a young lad living in these parts, not long since at all,
and his name was Francis John.</p>
<p>It chanced of a May morning that water was scarce for the tea, the
way his mother put a bucket in his hand and hunted him off to the
spring.</p>
<p>Now an old lassie lived by her lone in a little wee house was built
right close to the path. The door stood open that morning, and my brave
Francis John looked in when he went on his way to the well. He seen the
old girl sitting on a small creepy stool by the fire, with a row of
clay images baking in front of the turf. Wasn&rsquo;t she singing a

<p>With that she remarked a little wee boy sitting down by the hedge,
he stitching away at a brogue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had a hold of yon lad,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
make him discover a treasure&mdash;for the like of him knows where gold
does be hid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She juked up behind him, like a cat would be after a bird, and she
caught a strong grip of his neck. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p>Well he let an odious screech out of him, for he was horrid
surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have you, my gosoon,&rdquo; says she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh surely you have, mam,&rdquo; he answers. &ldquo;The
strength of your thumb is destroying my thrapple this day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you show me a treasure?&rdquo; says she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have you to know,&rdquo; he replies, &ldquo;that
the pot of gold I could convey you in sight of is guarded by the
appearance of a very strange frog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do I care for the creeping beasts of the world,&rdquo;
says she. &ldquo;Worse nor a frog wouldn&rsquo;t scare me at
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a terrible fine woman, mistress dear,&rdquo;
says the leprachaun. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve travelled a power of the earth
and I never came in with your equal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on with your old-fashioned chat,&rdquo; she replies, but
she was middling well pleased all the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a small little fellow,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;and I
couldn&rsquo;t keep up with yourself. But it&rsquo;s light in the body
I am, the way I&rsquo;d be never a burden at all and I sitting up on
the handle of the basket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up with you,&rdquo; she answers, &ldquo;for I&rsquo;ll

are not speaking the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she didn&rsquo;t find the least burden more on the basket when
himself was on the handle.</p>
<p>He was a great warrant to flatter, and he had her in humour that day
all the while he was watching out for a chance to escape, but she kept
a hold of his ear.</p>
<p>What did he do only put his two wee hands down into the basket and
he began for to bail out the eggs. She fetched him a terrible clout,
but the harder she beat him the faster he threw out the eggs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh mam! oh mam!&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;what for are you
skelping my head?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To make you quit breaking my eggs, you unmannerly
coley,&rdquo; says she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure it&rsquo;s doing you favour I am,&rdquo; he replies.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have you to know when I spill an egg on the ground a
well-grown spring chicken leps out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quit raving,&rdquo; says she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you doubt my word,&rdquo; he makes answer, &ldquo;let you
turn and look back at the chickens are flocking along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that she turned her head, and the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

one spring from the basket into the hedge, and he vanished away from
the place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wee lad has fooled me entirely,&rdquo; says she,
&ldquo;and my beautiful eggs are destroyed&mdash;but I am the finest
woman he&rsquo;s seen, and that is a good thing to know!&rdquo;

<p>There was a man in the olden time, and he owned a snug little
farm.</p>
<p>What did he do, of a winter&rsquo;s day, only break a great branch
off a lone bush for to burn in the fire. A thorn went into his hand and
it pierced it through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a sore jag,&rdquo; says he.</p>
<p>But there was a little grey woman sitting in under the lone bush,
and she let a terrible laugh.</p>
<p>There were two of the neighbours seen what occurred, and they
passing down through the field. One of them ran away home, but the
other, a venturesome lad, came across.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no woman here,&rdquo; says the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I seen her a while past, and I coming down to your side. She
was sitting in under the bush, but now she is gone. When you drove the
thorn through your hand she let a lamentable laugh that was worse nor a

<p>The man didn&rsquo;t believe it at all. But the jag in his hand
festered up and he died for breaking the branch of the thorn.

<p>There was a woman renowned for making the best of good butter.</p>
<p>Now it chanced in the spring that her man had three boys hired for
to work at the setting of spuds. One morning they passed through the
house when the churn was a making, and not one put his hand to the work
nor uttered a blessing upon it.</p>
<p>Herself was horrid annoyed to think they&rsquo;d be that unseemly
and ignorant, yet she passed no remark of the sort. Didn&rsquo;t her
whole morning&rsquo;s work go to loss for no yield come on the

<p>She was not very great with her neighbours, and the first time she

<p>There was once a man of these parts and he had a great longing for
to find a treasure.</p>
<p>It chanced one evening that he seen a gankeynogue in the field,
sitting in under a bush, and he says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yon lad will surely be worth a powerful weight of
gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that he went over and caught a hold of the gankey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let you discover a treasure,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;or else
I&rsquo;ll keep you like a dog on a chain from this out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep away!&rdquo; says the gankey. &ldquo;How would a poor
creature like myself be finding treasure for a strong farmer!&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e2173" href="#xd25e2173" name=
"xd25e2173">198</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Let you not let on to be miserable,&rdquo; says the man,
&ldquo;for well I know it&rsquo;s great wealth you enjoy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it me!&rdquo; says the gankeynogue. &ldquo;Sure I support
a lengthy family entirely by my own industry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the farmer would not believe a word of the sort. He carried the
gankey to his house and put him into a big oak chest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never get out except for to show me where
treasure is lodged,&rdquo; he allows.</p>
<p>But the gankeynogue wasn&rsquo;t in notion of giving the least
information. He sat up in the oak chest, hammering, shouting and
singing until he had the people&rsquo;s heads light.</p>
<p>All the while the farmer was determined to get the better of him and
he never agreed to let him go.</p>
<p>The lad was his tenth day in the chest when the man of the house
came running in that evening, shouting at the top of his voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Darragh fort&rsquo;s on fire! Darragh fort&rsquo;s on
fire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that the gankey began the most woeful lamentations, and he
hammering like mad to get out of the chest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ails you at all?&rdquo; asks the farmer. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e2195" href="#xd25e2195" name=
"xd25e2195">199</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;My wife and family are in that place,&rdquo; says the gankey.
&ldquo;Let me away to bring them safe from the fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you show me a treasure?&rdquo; asks the man. &ldquo;Aye
surely!&rdquo; says the gankeynogue. &ldquo;But let&rsquo;s go first to
Darragh fort to save my weak family, and then I&rsquo;ll bestow the
treasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the two started off for Darragh fort, and it not on fire at
all&mdash;that was a story the man was after inventing for to scare the
gankeynogue.</p>
<p>When they landed in sight of the place the man allowed the fire be
to have burnt out. Didn&rsquo;t the gankey make a run and lep in among
the trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m safe from you now,&rdquo; says he.</p>
<p>But the man never let on to be vexed that he couldn&rsquo;t see the
lad any more, he listened to his voice speaking for to know the
direction he went. Then he lay down in that part of the fort and let on
to be asleep.</p>
<p>After a while he heard the gankeynogue telling his wife about how he
was kept in the chest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was ten days in that place,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;And I
full of venom against the farmer. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd25e2213" href="#xd25e2213" name="xd25e2213">200</a>]</span>But
it&rsquo;s the cunning lad I am, for I never let on where the treasure
is buried at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo; asks the gankeynogue&rsquo;s wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under a stone in the street before his house,&rdquo; says the
gankey. &ldquo;And herself tripped and spilled a bucket of milk just
over the place this morning. I was looking out on a hole in the chest,
and still I never let on one word when I seen what happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a wise little fellow, sure enough,&rdquo; says
his wife.</p>
<p>The farmer got up and away home with him after hearing what they
said. He asked herself where she spilled the milk at the morning of the
day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By that stone,&rdquo; says she, setting her foot on a flag in
the street.</p>
<p>He brought the loy and a crowbar for to hoke up the place, and
didn&rsquo;t he discover a beautiful treasure of gold. <span class=

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a slow worker I&rsquo;m counted in these

pit at the man is cobbling below. I warrant it&rsquo;s three nails
he&rsquo;s driving for each one of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lad looked over the edge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no man in it at all!&rdquo; says he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is not,&rdquo; says he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a sore chastisement waiting on you for

with the god Pan, and the great Angus Og.</p>

above the ordinary things of life, and come back to earth carrying with
us the abiding memory of the rarely humorous and the beautiful. We have
read nothing quite like <i>The Crock of Gold</i>. It has a charm and
humour peculiar to itself, and places its author high in the ranks of
imaginative poetic writers.&rdquo;</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
